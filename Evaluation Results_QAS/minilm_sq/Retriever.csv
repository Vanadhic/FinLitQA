"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.

A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund.

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers.

However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity.

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market.

"riders offered are Accidental Death, Critical Illness Rider, Term rider. In Accidental Death or Permanent Disability Benefit Rider provides the policyholder with cover in the event of an accident being the cause of death.

Waiver of monthly premium offers the policyholder a waiver from premium payment if he/she meets with an accident as covered under the rider. Any refund of premiums is applicable only within 15 days of receipt of policy documen. Most insurance companies offer a free-look period of 30 days to customers. Customers can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies.
There are no partial withdrawals allowed for pension and annuity plans. For other plans, a partial withdrawal is generally allowed from the 5th year onwards. The entire premium amount is used to buy units. The quantum of units bought depends on the ULIP and the year. ULIPs usually charge a premium allocation charge and a mortality charge. A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund. ULIPs can be surrendered upon payment of a surrender charge.

"ULIP

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.
On basis of death benefit it is divided into Type I and Type II ULIP. In Type I ULIP the beneficiary gets the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher. In Type II ULIP the beneficiary gets both the assured value and the fund value.

"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.
Features of PMJJBY:
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme available for renewal every year. The scheme is available to people between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a savings bank account. The scheme asks for an annual premium from the insured members, which will automatically be deducted from the member’s bank accounts. It must be noted that the scheme offers a term plan wherein the insurance company will pay the insurance amount to the member’s family only upon the death of the insured member. In case of death of the member (who is insured), the nominee or the insured member’s family will be paid a fixed amount of Rs.2 Lakh. The policy will automatically mature when the insured member reaches 55 years of age.

"riders offered are Accidental Death, Critical Illness Rider, Term rider. In Accidental Death or Permanent Disability Benefit Rider provides the policyholder with cover in the event of an accident being the cause of death. Term rider provides the policyholder with a monthly income to the policyholder’s beneficiary in the event of the policyholder’s death.
Waiver of monthly premium offers the policyholder a waiver from premium payment if he/she meets with an accident as covered under the rider. Any refund of premiums is applicable only within 15 days of receipt of policy documen. Most insurance companies offer a free-look period of 30 days to customers. Customers can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies.
There are no partial withdrawals allowed for pension and annuity plans. For other plans, a partial withdrawal is generally allowed from the 5th year onwards. The entire premium amount is used to buy units. The quantum of units bought depends on the ULIP and the year. ULIPs usually charge a premium allocation charge and a mortality charge. A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund. ULIPs can be surrendered upon payment of a surrender charge.

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.

"ULIP

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.
On basis of death benefit it is divided into Type I and Type II ULIP. In Type I ULIP the beneficiary gets the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher. In Type II ULIP the beneficiary gets both the assured value and the fund value.

Waiver of monthly premium offers the policyholder a waiver from premium payment if he/she meets with an accident as covered under the rider. Any refund of premiums is applicable only within 15 days of receipt of policy documen. Most insurance companies offer a free-look period of 30 days to customers. Customers can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies.
There are no partial withdrawals allowed for pension and annuity plans. For other plans, a partial withdrawal is generally allowed from the 5th year onwards. The entire premium amount is used to buy units. The quantum of units bought depends on the ULIP and the year. ULIPs usually charge a premium allocation charge and a mortality charge. A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund.

"ULIP

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.
On basis of death benefit it is divided into Type I and Type II ULIP. In Type I ULIP the beneficiary gets the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher. In Type II ULIP the beneficiary gets both the assured value and the fund value.

"riders offered are Accidental Death, Critical Illness Rider, Term rider. In Accidental Death or Permanent Disability Benefit Rider provides the policyholder with cover in the event of an accident being the cause of death. Term rider provides the policyholder with a monthly income to the policyholder’s beneficiary in the event of the policyholder’s death.
Waiver of monthly premium offers the policyholder a waiver from premium payment if he/she meets with an accident as covered under the rider. Any refund of premiums is applicable only within 15 days of receipt of policy documen. Most insurance companies offer a free-look period of 30 days to customers. Customers can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies.
There are no partial withdrawals allowed for pension and annuity plans. For other plans, a partial withdrawal is generally allowed from the 5th year onwards. The entire premium amount is used to buy units. The quantum of units bought depends on the ULIP and the year. ULIPs usually charge a premium allocation charge and a mortality charge. A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund. ULIPs can be surrendered upon payment of a surrender charge.

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.

"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.
Features of PMJJBY:
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme available for renewal every year. The scheme is available to people between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a savings bank account. The scheme asks for an annual premium from the insured members, which will automatically be deducted from the member’s bank accounts. It must be noted that the scheme offers a term plan wherein the insurance company will pay the insurance amount to the member’s family only upon the death of the insured member. In case of death of the member (who is insured), the nominee or the insured member’s family will be paid a fixed amount of Rs.2 Lakh. The policy will automatically mature when the insured member reaches 55 years of age. It must be noted that irrespective of the date when the policy was purchased, it",86b6adea4b99d7e62c865b8c75353e3a-0,document,['d635e12585c3e386a02b4fb885fdc468-0'],"['PMSBY\n\nPradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or SPMSBY is a social security scheme that offers one-year accidental death and disability cover, that can be renewed yearly.

"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.
Features of PMJJBY:
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme available for renewal every year. The scheme is available to people between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a savings bank account. The scheme asks for an annual premium from the insured members, which will automatically be deducted from the member’s bank accounts. It must be noted that the scheme offers a term plan wherein the insurance company will pay the insurance amount to the member’s family only upon the death of the insured member. In case of death of the member (who is insured), the nominee or the insured member’s family will be paid a fixed amount of Rs.2 Lakh. The policy will automatically mature when the insured member reaches 55 years of age. It must be noted that irrespective of the date when the policy was purchased, it",86b6adea4b99d7e62c865b8c75353e3a-0,document,['d635e12585c3e386a02b4fb885fdc468-0'],"['PMSBY\n\nPradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or SPMSBY is a social security scheme that offers one-year accidental death and disability cover, that can be renewed yearly.

"ULIP

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.
On basis of death benefit it is divided into Type I and Type II ULIP. In Type I ULIP the beneficiary gets the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher. In Type II ULIP the beneficiary gets both the assured value and the fund value.

"ULIP

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.
On basis of death benefit it is divided into Type I and Type II ULIP. In Type I ULIP the beneficiary gets the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher. In Type II ULIP the beneficiary gets both the assured value and the fund value.

"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.
Features of PMJJBY:
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme available for renewal every year. The scheme is available to people between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a savings bank account. The scheme asks for an annual premium from the insured members, which will automatically be deducted from the member’s bank accounts. It must be noted that the scheme offers a term plan wherein the insurance company will pay the insurance amount to the member’s family only upon the death of the insured member. In case of death of the member (who is insured), the nominee or the insured member’s family will be paid a fixed amount of Rs.2 Lakh. The policy will automatically mature when the insured member reaches 55 years of age.

In Accidental Death or Permanent Disability Benefit Rider provides the policyholder with cover in the event of an accident being the cause of death. Term rider provides the policyholder with a monthly income to the policyholder’s beneficiary in the event of the policyholder’s death.
Waiver of monthly premium offers the policyholder a waiver from premium payment if he/she meets with an accident as covered under the rider. Any refund of premiums is applicable only within 15 days of receipt of policy documen. Most insurance companies offer a free-look period of 30 days to customers. Customers can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies.
There are no partial withdrawals allowed for pension and annuity plans. For other plans, a partial withdrawal is generally allowed from the 5th year onwards. The entire premium amount is used to buy units. The quantum of units bought depends on the ULIP and the year. ULIPs usually charge a premium allocation charge and a mortality charge. A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund.

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.

"ULIP

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.
On basis of death benefit it is divided into Type I and Type II ULIP. In Type I ULIP the beneficiary gets the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher. In Type II ULIP the beneficiary gets both the assured value and the fund value.

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.

"riders offered are Accidental Death, Critical Illness Rider, Term rider. In Accidental Death or Permanent Disability Benefit Rider provides the policyholder with cover in the event of an accident being the cause of death. Term rider provides the policyholder with a monthly income to the policyholder’s beneficiary in the event of the policyholder’s death.
Waiver of monthly premium offers the policyholder a waiver from premium payment if he/she meets with an accident as covered under the rider. Any refund of premiums is applicable only within 15 days of receipt of policy documen. Most insurance companies offer a free-look period of 30 days to customers. Customers can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies.
There are no partial withdrawals allowed for pension and annuity plans. For other plans, a partial withdrawal is generally allowed from the 5th year onwards. The entire premium amount is used to buy units. The quantum of units bought depends on the ULIP and the year. ULIPs usually charge a premium allocation charge and a mortality charge. A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund. ULIPs can be surrendered upon payment of a surrender charge.

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity.

In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.

"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.
Features of PMJJBY:
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme available for renewal every year. The scheme is available to people between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a savings bank account. The scheme asks for an annual premium from the insured members, which will automatically be deducted from the member’s bank accounts. It must be noted that the scheme offers a term plan wherein the insurance company will pay the insurance amount to the member’s family only upon the death of the insured member. In case of death of the member (who is insured), the nominee or the insured member’s family will be paid a fixed amount of Rs.2 Lakh. The policy will automatically mature when the insured member reaches 55 years of age.

In Accidental Death or Permanent Disability Benefit Rider provides the policyholder with cover in the event of an accident being the cause of death. Term rider provides the policyholder with a monthly income to the policyholder’s beneficiary in the event of the policyholder’s death.
Waiver of monthly premium offers the policyholder a waiver from premium payment if he/she meets with an accident as covered under the rider. Any refund of premiums is applicable only within 15 days of receipt of policy documen. Most insurance companies offer a free-look period of 30 days to customers. Customers can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies.
There are no partial withdrawals allowed for pension and annuity plans. For other plans, a partial withdrawal is generally allowed from the 5th year onwards. The entire premium amount is used to buy units. The quantum of units bought depends on the ULIP and the year. ULIPs usually charge a premium allocation charge and a mortality charge. A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund. ULIPs can be surrendered upon payment of a surrender charge.

"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.
Features of PMJJBY:
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme available for renewal every year. The scheme is available to people between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a savings bank account. The scheme asks for an annual premium from the insured members, which will automatically be deducted from the member’s bank accounts. It must be noted that the scheme offers a term plan wherein the insurance company will pay the insurance amount to the member’s family only upon the death of the insured member. In case of death of the member (who is insured), the nominee or the insured member’s family will be paid a fixed amount of Rs.2 Lakh. The policy will automatically mature when the insured member reaches 55 years of age. It must be noted that irrespective of the date when the policy was purchased, it",86b6adea4b99d7e62c865b8c75353e3a-0,document,['f9732dd2411b250f2227efc3f40af4ec-0'],"['ULIP\n\nULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world.

"riders offered are Accidental Death, Critical Illness Rider, Term rider. In Accidental Death or Permanent Disability Benefit Rider provides the policyholder with cover in the event of an accident being the cause of death. Term rider provides the policyholder with a monthly income to the policyholder’s beneficiary in the event of the policyholder’s death.
Waiver of monthly premium offers the policyholder a waiver from premium payment if he/she meets with an accident as covered under the rider. Any refund of premiums is applicable only within 15 days of receipt of policy documen. Most insurance companies offer a free-look period of 30 days to customers. Customers can freely switch between funds as per their wish and convenience. However, a certain switching charge is applicable and levied by insurance companies.
There are no partial withdrawals allowed for pension and annuity plans. For other plans, a partial withdrawal is generally allowed from the 5th year onwards. The entire premium amount is used to buy units. The quantum of units bought depends on the ULIP and the year. ULIPs usually charge a premium allocation charge and a mortality charge. A mortality charge is levied on ULIPs to cover the cost of insurance. If you fail to pay the premium within the first 3 years of the policy, insurance cover is immediately discontinued. For premiums not paid after 3 years, the surrender value is paid and the contract is terminated. The fund value is calculated by multiplying the total number of units in the policy with the Net Asset Value. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price of units in a fund. ULIPs can be surrendered upon payment of a surrender charge.

"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.
Features of PMJJBY:
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme available for renewal every year. The scheme is available to people between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a savings bank account. The scheme asks for an annual premium from the insured members, which will automatically be deducted from the member’s bank accounts. It must be noted that the scheme offers a term plan wherein the insurance company will pay the insurance amount to the member’s family only upon the death of the insured member. In case of death of the member (who is insured), the nominee or the insured member’s family will be paid a fixed amount of Rs.2 Lakh. The policy will automatically mature when the insured member reaches 55 years of age.

"PMJJBY

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.
Features of PMJJBY:
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana is a one-year life insurance scheme available for renewal every year. The scheme is available to people between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a savings bank account. The scheme asks for an annual premium from the insured members, which will automatically be deducted from the member’s bank accounts. It must be noted that the scheme offers a term plan wherein the insurance company will pay the insurance amount to the member’s family only upon the death of the insured member. In case of death of the member (who is insured), the nominee or the insured member’s family will be paid a fixed amount of Rs.2 Lakh. The policy will automatically mature when the insured member reaches 55 years of age.

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or PMJBY was started by the then Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley in the annual financial budget of 2015. The scheme was actually launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi in Kolkata considering the fact that as of the mentioned year (May 2015), only 20% of the country’s population had an insurance policy in their name. The main idea behind the scheme was to increase the number of health insured citizens in the country. Additionally, the bank accounts that were initially opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be used for this scheme as well. This was done to reduce the number of accounts under the scheme with zero balance. The scheme offers a life cover of Rs.2 Lakh to the insured member for the time period of one year, stretching from June 1 to May 31; this time period will be renewed every year.

"ULIP

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.
On basis of death benefit it is divided into Type I and Type II ULIP. In Type I ULIP the beneficiary gets the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher. In Type II ULIP the beneficiary gets both the assured value and the fund value.

"ULIP

ULIP is a financial instrument that offers customers best of both the insurance and the investment world. ULIPs offer customers insurance cover as well as a choice to capitalize on various investment tools like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The double benefit of protection combined with freedom to choose your investment avenue makes ULIPs a truly popular financial instrument among customers. With ULIPs being life insurance products, they offer tax benefits in the form of tax free maturity. However this tax benefit depends on the type of ULIP invested, as equity funds could be taxed 15% under certain conditions. ULIPs do not have high charges associated with them. IRDA has capped the annual charge on ULIPs at 2-2.25% p.a. for the initial 10 years, with the charges on par with those of mutual funds. ULIPs are a long term investment option due to the increased lock-in period which also reap bigger returns.
Types of ULIPs:
On basis of investment ULIP is divided into Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative ULIP. In Aggressive ULIP 80-100% of investment amount is invested in equity. In Balanced ULIP 40-60% of investment amount is invested in equity and the rest is invested in debt market. In Conservative ULIP: Here 20% of investment amount is put in equity and the rest is invested in the debt market.
On basis of death benefit it is divided into Type I and Type II ULIP. In Type I ULIP the beneficiary gets the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher. In Type II ULIP the beneficiary gets both the assured value and the fund value.
