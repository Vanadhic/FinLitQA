For the up-gradation, expansion of existing PMEGP / REGP / MUDRA units, applicants can now apply for a 2nd Loan up to Rs. 1 crore. Applicants can also avail Government Subsidy from 15% to 20% for the 2nd loan under the PMEGP scheme.\nDocuments required for Loans under PMEGP Scheme:\nDuly filled application form with passport-sized photographs, Project report, Applicant’s Identity & Address Proofs, Applicant’s PAN card, Aadhaar card & VIII Pass certificate, Special category certificate, if required, Certificate of Entrepreneur Development Programme (EDP) training, Certificate for SC/ST/OBC/Minority/Ex-Servicemen/PHC, Certificate of academic and technical courses, if any, Any other document required by the bank or NBFC are needed.\nPMEGP Loan Allocation: Here is a look at the breakup of the money that is given under a PMEGP Loan. Once the application is approved, the bank allocates 95% of the project cost (for weaker sections of society) or 90% (for general applicants). Of this, 15-35% is the margin money or subsidy that is provided by the government. The amount of margin money that will be taken by banks will be proportional to the actual capital expenditure availed by the applicant. The rest of the margin money that is proportional to the amount not availed will be returned to the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC). The rest of the funds (i.e. 90/95% of funds allocated less than 15-35% subsidy) are provided by the bank as a term loan or PMEGP loan. The rate of interest on the PMEGP loan will be at a normal rate as applicable to the MSE sector. After an initial moratorium, that usually does not exceed 6 months, the bank may provide a repayment schedule of 3 years for the borrowers to pay back the PMEGP loan. The margin money or subsidy is kept in a separate savings account that is linked to the loan account, and locked in for a period of 3 years, after which it is adjusted with the PMEGP loan or released. The PMEGP loan requires that the working capital expenditure be equal to the cash credit limit at least once in the three years after the margin money is locked in. Moreover, it should not be less than 75% utilisation of the sanctioned limit. The PMEGP loan is given for enterprises in Agro-based Food Processing, Forest-based Products, Hand Made Paper and Fibre, Mineral-based Products, Polymer and Chemical-based Products, Rural Engineering and Bio-Tech, Service and Textile.",

Bank accepts different types of deposits from the public such as Saving Deposits, Fixed Deposits, Current Deposits, and Recurring Deposits.\nGranting of Loans & Advances:\nThe deposits accepted from the public are utilised by the banks to advance loans to the businesses and individuals to meet their uncertainties. Bank charges a higher rate of interest on loans and advances than what it pays on deposits. The difference between the lending interest rate and interest rate for deposits is bank profit. Loans and Advances includes Bank Overdraft for current account holders. It allows holders to withdraw money anytime more than available in bank balance but up to the provided limit. An overdraft facility is granted against collateral security. The interest for overdraft is paid only on the borrowed amount for the period for which the loan is taken. Cash Credit in the form of  short term loan facility up to a specific limit fixed in advance. Banks allow the customer to take a loan against a mortgage of certain property (tangible assets and / guarantees). Cash credit is given to any type of account holders and also to those who do not have an account with a bank. Interest is charged on the amount withdrawn in excess of the limit. Through cash credit, a larger amount of loan is sanctioned than that of overdraft for a longer period. Banks lend money to the customer for short term or medium periods of say 1 to 5 years against tangible assets. Nowadays, banks do lend money for the long term. The borrower repays the money either in a lump-sum amount or in the form of instalments spread over a pre-decided time period. Bank charges interest on the actual amount of loan sanctioned, whether withdrawn or not. The interest rate is lower than overdrafts and cash credits facilities.\nDiscounting the bill of exchang is a type of short term loan, where the seller discounts the bill from the bank for some fees. The bank advances money by discounting or purchasing the bills of exchange. It pays the bill amount to the drawer (seller) on behalf of the drawee (buyer) by deducting usual discount charges. On maturity, the bank presents the bill to the drawee or acceptor to collect the bill amount.\nAgency Functions of Bank:\nBanks are the agents for their customers, hence it has to perform various agency functions such as Transferring of funds from one branch/place to another. \nPeriodic Collections like Collecting dividend, salary, pension, and similar periodic collections on the clients’ behalf. Bank makes periodic payments of rents, electricity bills, etc. on behalf of the client and collecting money from the bills of exchanges, the bank collects the money of the cheques through the clearing section of its customers.

          "context": "35. NEFT_RTGS_AND_IMPS:\n\nNEFT or National Electronics Fund Transfer is a payment system which allows one-to-one funds transfer. Under the facility of NEFT, you can transfer funds electronically from one bank branch to another individual. You can also make an NEFT payment to a firm or corporate, which has an account with any bank branch in India. Fund transfer through NEFT is done within a specific time slot each day and it does not work in real-time. If you do not have a bank account, you can always deposit cash using the NEFT facility. These cash remittances will be restricted to a maximum of Rs.50,000 for each transaction. Earlier, the NEFT transaction timings for most banks was between 8 a.m. And 6 p.m. from Monday to Friday and 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Saturdays. However, with effect from 16 December 2019, you can transfer money via NEFT 24x7. Money can be transferred via NEFT on holidays and weekends as well. The system allows the one-way cross-border transfer of funds from India to Nepal. This is under the Indo-Nepal Remittance Facility Scheme. It avoids the need for a physical instruments or parties to transfer funds. All NEFT settlements are made in a batch-wise format. You can initiate internet banking from any location. The confirmation of a transaction will be received via email and SMS notifications. The receiver will get the amount for the NEFT transactions within two business hours. It is mandatory to provide the IFSC code along with other details to initiate fund transfers. Not all banks are part of the NEFT network. The information about all NEFT-enabled banks is available on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) website. All fund transfer transactions will be processed in a batch-wise format and the money will be credited within 2 working days.\nReal-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) is a fund transfer method via which money is sent immediately without any delays. RTGS is typically meant for larger value transactions and the minimum amount that can be sent via this mode is Rs.2 lakh. You can use the net banking or mobile banking facility to transfer money via RTGS. You need the bank details of the individual to transfer money via this mode. Transfers can be scheduled in advance as well. In case of online transfers, no charges are levied for RTGS transactions. In case the RTGS transaction is completed at a bank branch, a charge of Rs.15 plus GST is levied. RTGS transactions can be completed on a 24/7 basis, expect between 11:30 p.m. and 00:30 a.m. due to cut-off.\nRTGS is used by the Central Bank of India to help in minimising the risk that is involved in all transactions that are of high-value. NEFT transactions are settled in batches, while RTGS transactions are settled individually. Remember that all RTGS transactions are mainly for larger value transactions. The minimum amount for RTGS transactions is Rs.2 lakh. There is no maximum limit. Generally, the funds are credited instantly. The bank will ideally credit the money within a 30 minute time frame. RTGS transactions can be scheduled 3 working days in advance.\nIMPS means Immediate Payment Service. This is another type of EFT that transfers funds in real time. Although there are other mediums of EFT available in the country right now such as NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) and RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) but IMPS has become widely popular in a short span of time and especially among the younger population of the country.\nThis is because IMPS is a no-fuss service and does not require complete bank details of the beneficiary. The service runs through mobile banking facility provided by the bank and requires only the bank account registered mobile number and MMID of the beneficiary to receive funds. Another reason for IMPS being so popular is that it is available 24/7 and 365 days. This means you can send and receive money seamlessly regardless of bank holidays and public holidays. In addition, IMPS also facilitates UPI (Unified Payment Interface) payments.\nUsing IMPS through phone means, you must have mobile banking facility offered by the bank. This facility is usually free of cost and only a few banks charge a minimal annual fee. After that, you can download the mobile banking application of the respective bank. The last and most important thing you have to do is to generate a 7-digit MMID (Mobile Money Identifier) as you cannot transfer funds in any condition without this unique ID. This works as a virtual address for both sending and receiving funds. Despite being the fastest medium of money transfer, IMPS is a form of wire transfer that uses the internet as a medium to transfer information. In such situations, you have to be careful and consider a number of factors while using IMPS. IMPS is an inexpensive mode of fund transfer. Other fund transfer mediums such as NEFT and RTGS charge significantly higher than IMPS. The maximum fee for fund transfer in IMPS does not go beyond Rs. 25 + GST which is fairly low for a medium which transfers money in real time.",

          "context": "25. GOLD_LOAN\n\nGold loan is a type of secured loan, the loan is provided against collateral in the form of different types of gold jewellery or gold coins. You have to deposit your gold with the lender i.e. NBFC or bank and you get the deposited gold ornaments or coins back only after you have paid back the loan amount in full including interest. Gold loan business, being secure, features short processing times, a low interest rate and short to medium term tenure. This loan is a good option, if you are looking for instant liquidity. Also, since the approval of this loan does not depend upon your credit history or income, you need not worry about your adversely impacting your credit score nor scramble for income proofs for loan approval. Lending institutions offer loan of up to 75% of the gold value, after checking the metal for purity and ascertaining the market gold prices. While gold jewelry is perfectly acceptable to any bank or NBFC as collateral, bars are not accepted and only specific types of gold coins are accepted as collateral by banks only. If the ornaments provided feature precious stones, they are valued only on the basis of the weight of gold in the ornaments.\nBenefits of a Gold Loan:\nGold loans feature a low interest rate as compared to most other loan options. Gold Loans tenure ranges from a few days to 5 years or more depending upon the lender. The repayment options on gold loan can be selected as per the choice of the borrower. In most cases, the lender does not charge a pre-payment penalty on gold loans. Minimal documentation is required and PAN Card is not mandatory for this loan. Fast disbursement of loan is provided within a few minutes to a few hours. Since it is a secured loan, there is no requirement of a good credit history to avail a gold loan.You have an option to pay only the interest component and the principle can be paid as a lump sum amount at the end of the loan tenure. For those of you involved in agriculture, gold loan schemes can be availed at a reduced rate of interest which can be as low as 8%. Since your gold is the collateral, which is deposited with the lender, the paper work involved is bare minimum. All you require is your personal id and address proof. The loan disbursal time can be as short as 5 minutes. Most gold loan providers charge only a small percentage, usually 3% to 5% over the base rate when providing a gold loan. Thus for a base rate of 10%, the interest on a gold loan can vary from 13%-15% per annum. Gold loans feature a tenure that ranges from a few days to 5 years. The loan interest rate also tends to vary based on the tenure of the loan as well as the gold loan amount.\nGold Loan Eligibility Criteria:\nThere are no specific gold loans eligibility criteria to satisfy to get gold loan. Anyone can apply for gold loan, as long as the person seeking a loan owns the gold. The sanctioning gold loan is determined by the value of gold the borrower submits.The person should be above the age of 18 years. Unlike other loans where documentation is an important part of the process, gold loan documents required to be submitted are only the basic KYCs. Gold loans tenure are usually short, ranging from a period of 1 year to a maximum of 2 years. Therefore, the borrower should be sure about his repayment capacity for the loan within the stipulated time. Gold loan rates are lower as compared to other unsecured loans. But, gold loan rate of interest can vary from one lender to another lender. Therefore it is best to compare the available options. The amount of loan that will be sanctioned to you is limited up to 80-90% of the value of Gold, as per current market gold prices, that you pledge for the loan.\nGold loans have the benefit of minimum documentation, faster approval and quick disbursal. The lender keeps your gold as a security for the loan and in case you default on your payments, he has the authority to confiscate it. However, it is very important to know the credibility of your lender as your gold stays with him for the loan tenure. Therefore, it is best to choose the reputed lenders with proven track record. Gold loan repayment must be done on time defaulting on payments can affect your credit score. Further, if you do not pay back the loan amount, the surrendered gold can be seized by the bank.",

          "context": "27. OVERDRAFT\n\nOverdraft is a financial instrument in which the money can be withdrawn from the current or savings account, even if the account balance goes below zero. It is a type of extension of monetary limit offered by banks and that money is said to be ‘overdrawn’. An authorized overdraft limit is assigned for each customer depending on their relationship with the bank. The customer can withdraw money up to the assigned limit. Banks do charge interest rates on the money withdrawn in form of overdraft. The interest rate on overdraft facilities offered by private and public sector banks shall vary from lender to lender and depends on the required overdraft amount, repayment tenure, and relationship with the respective bank or financial institution.\nFeatures of an Overdraft Facility:\nOverdraft Account is a facility that can be availed by maintaining any Savings or Current bank account. The minimum age criteria are 18 years and maximum up to 65 years for bank account holders. Several private sector banks are offering this facility for both salary and savings account holders. The money extension is granted on the basis of the customer’s account value, repayment history, or credit score. It is short-term credit provided by the bank that needs to be paid within the stipulated time limit, usually 12 months or even lesser. So it shall be considered as a current liability.\nCredit amount or overdraft attracts interest for the time of use which can be from a couple of days to a few weeks. As per the RBI regulations, current accounts and cash credit accounts are eligible for a maximum of Rs. 50,000 Overdraft is a significantly useful feature provided by the banks, as it offers aid to businesses in terms of cash flow to meet their working capital expenditure. Businesses often have to wait for the payments from their clients and this results in delayed payments from their side as well. With the support of overdraft in their current accounts, businesses can sign cheques for their clients beyond the available funds in their accounts. This prevents cheque dishonor and maintains the reputation of the business, as well. \nTYPES OF OVERDRAFT FACILITY:\nOverdraft against Salary: Salary accounts opened by the businesses for their employees are eligible for this facility. The minimum requirement to avail overdraft facility in a salary account is to have a regular monthly salary credited by the company and the company should be on the approval list of the bank. Banks offer overdraft up to 3 times the current salary of the customer. Customers are required to pay interest only on the utilized amount with the flexibility to repay the amount anytime without pre-closure charges. The minimum salary limit varies from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000 according to specific banks. This type of overdraft does not require any security or collateral. Some banks even offer overdraft amounts of up to Rs. 4 lakh.\nOverdraft on Savings Account: Despite being a relatively new concept in the country, overdraft on saving accounts has become quite popular due to being backed by the government. All the savings accounts opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna are eligible for an overdraft of Rs. 5,000 or 4 times monthly accent balance (whichever is lower). The accounts must be satisfactorily operated for a period of 6 months to avail this facility and only one member of a family is eligible for it. The facility is granted to the earning member of the family, preferably women. The account must be linked with an Aadhar card.\nThe account holder must have another savings account for compliance with the RBI directive as well. Minors and KCC (Kisan Credit Card) individuals are not eligible for the scheme. There is also a renewal fee associated with the facility. However, the interest rate cannot exceed 2% above the base rate. This facility does not attract any processing fee.\nOverdraft against Time Deposits: Time deposits, such as fixed deposits are also eligible for overdraft facilities.\nThe main difference between bank overdraft and bank loan is that in overdraft the interest rate is paid only on the utilized amount, whereas in a bank loan you have to pay the interest rate on the whole amount. If you are unable to repay the overdraft amount on time, then the bank is liable to deduct the outstanding amount plus the interest rate from your current or savings account linked with the bank. \n",

          "context": "29. DEMAND_DRAFT\n\nA demand draft or a DD is a negotiable instrument issued by the bank. The meaning of negotiable instrument is that it guarantees a certain amount of payment mentioning the name of the payee. It cannot be transferred to another person in any situation. The drafts are payable on demand.  It cannot be paid to the bearer but the beneficiary has to present the instrument directly to the branch. It can also be collected by the clearing mechanism of the bank. The draft facility is available for people regardless of them having a bank account or not. Anyone who wants to pay a certain amount to an institution or to someone with a proof of payment can issue a demand draft. Individuals can visit the bank and ask for a draft form or they can also fill the form online. The amount mentioned in the form can be paid either by cheque or cash. The form for demand drafts can be collected from the bank or can be filled online. You need to input some important details such as your mode of paying for the draft (cheque or cash), the name of the beneficiary, the place of encashing the draft, cheque number, your bank account number, signature, etc. You would also have to provide your PAN card details if you are paying more than Rs. 50,000 by cheque. The amount you give to issue a draft is immediately accepted by the bank whether it is cash or cheque and you have to go to the bank to cancel a DD as there is no online provision for it. As per the payment methods, there may be two cases in which you have to cancel the DD. If You Paid Through Cash, You have to submit the original draft along with the receipt to the bank to get the refund. The bank will deduct around Rs. 100 to Rs. 150. If you paid the amount through cheque and the amount is deducted from your bank account, you need to submit the original draft with a duly filled cancellation form and the amount will be credited back to your account with a deduction of Rs. 150. A draft is valid for a period of 3 months from the date of issue. The draft will be expired after that period if not presented to the bank. However, despite being expired, the money will not be refunded in the drawer’s account. The drawer then has to approach the bank to revalidate the draft. A DD can be issued either against money paid by a cheque or in cash. Demand draft issuance through cheque requires a bank account. The instructions include that the DDs above Rs. 20,000 will be issued invariably with account payee crossing. Banks also possess the right to issue a duplicate demand draft in the case of a missing or lost DD. Bank will charge a small fee and cancel the old draft and issue a new one. A demand draft worth Rs. 5,000 or less can be issued by the bank on the basis of adequate indemnity without obtaining NPA (Non-Payment Advice). Banks allow a maximum of Rs. 49,999 as RBI has given clear instructions to not issue a demand draft paid by cash for Rs. 50,000 or more.\nTypes of Demand Drafts:\nSight Demand Draft is approved and paid only after the verification of certain documents. The payee will not be able to receive any money if he/she fails to present any of the required documents.\nTime Demand Draft is payable only after a specific period of time and before that, it cannot be drawn from the bank. \nDemand Draft Fraud:\nA demand draft fraud is a scenario when someone issues a fake DD in the name of the payee. To avoid DD fraud Keep Proper Information of the Drawer, Always extract proper contact information of the drawer and do not forget to verify it. Always Keep a Copy of the Draft. Make a coloured photocopy of the draft and keep it safe. This will help you identify the methods used in forging the draft especially in situations where the draft carries a significant amount with them.Take Legal Action Immediately. Banks usually take legal action immediately against the payee when presented a fake draft. \nDemand drafts are always preferred by government and educational institutions because they have a value associated with them. The drawer has to pay the specified amount to the bank upfront before issuing the draft and this makes it a guarantee for the promised money. On the contrary, even the A/C Payee cheques do not assure that the payee will receive the payment. There are millions of cases of cheque frauds.",

LIFE_INSURANCE\n\nLife insurance provides financial protection to the family in cases like the sudden death or the permanent disability of the main earning member of the family. A life insurance policy helps in meeting three goals in life namely Protection, Investment and Savings. Life Insurance Premium is the amount paid to the insurance company for getting a life insurance policy. In case of a non-payment or a payment delay, the policy can be considered as a lapsed policy. However, before a policy happens to expire, you usually get a grace period of 30 days. The payment mode can be regular or single. Older you are, higher the premium amount. Premium amount for women is lower compared to that for men. In case you are a smoker, the premium will be higher because you are prone to higher risks in life. \nSum assured: Higher the sum assured or the death benefit, higher the premium amount to be paid. If the policy is for a longer duration, the premium amount will be higher.\nTypes of Life Insurance Policy:\nLife insurance is of 7 types. And each has its own features and specialties. You can choose them as per your need and requirement. They are: Term Insurance, Whole Life Insurance, Endowment Policy, Money Back Policy, Child Plan, Retirement or Annuity Plan and United Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP).\nTerm insurance is a Pure protection plan where the beneficiary gets the sum assured, also called death benefit, if the policyholder passes away during the term of the plan. However, if the insured survives the term plan, the coverage also ends, with the beneficiary not getting any money. Even the premium paid is not refunded to the insured. However, there are some term plans where the premium paid is returned, if the policyholder happens to the survive the plan. This payment is termed as survival benefit. The premium for such plans are quite high. \nWhole Life Insurance/Life Cover Insurance:\nUnder this policy, the insured is covered for the lifetime:e, i.e. till his/her death. The maturity age is usually 100 years. Thus, you need to keep paying the premiums till 100 years of your age. Here, the beneficiary gets the sum assured along with maturity benefits on the untimely demise of the policyholder. On the other hand, the policyholder gets to enjoy the survival benefits, in case he/she happens to survive the policy term. ULIP is a Life cover insurance.\t\nEndowment Policy:\nThis offers both coverage and a means for saving. Like any other life insurance plan, here, the beneficiary gets the sum assured in case of the death of the insured. However, if the insured survives the plan, he/she gets the maturity benefit. The policy can be both participating, where the insured gets bonus and dividends from the company, and non-participating, where the insured does not get bonus and dividends from the insurance company. An endowment policy can also be a ULIP, where a part of the premium is invested in market apart from a part being used in coverage.\nMoney Back Policy:\nIn this policy, the insured gets a certain percentage of the sum assured at regular intervals during the term of the policy. If the insured survives the tenure of the policy, he/she also gets the sum assured irrespective of the percentage of the sum assured already paid out to him/her. Thus, at the end, the insured gets the sum assured along with the accumulated bonus. Section 80C of the IT Act allows you to deduct up to Rs. 1,50,000 in life insurance premiums from your taxable income per year. In addition, Section 10(10)D exempts the maturity benefit of the money back policy from taxation\nChild Plan:\nIt is a combination of savings and insurance, where the insured can use the money for the future needs of the child like higher education. one can start investing soon after the birth of the child and one can withdraw money after the child reaches a certain age. Some child policies offer intermediate withdrawal options as well. This can be either a ULIP or an endowment plan.\nRetirement or Annuity Plan:\nLife insurance companies in India provide retirement plans which help create a corpus from which a regular income, called annuity or pension, is given to the insured after reaching a certain age.\nThere are 2 Types of Retirement Plans. Immediate Annuity and Deferred annuity. In Immediate annuity the insured gets the pension within one year of the premium amount being paid. In \nDeferred Annuity the insured decides a time frame after which he/she will get the annuity from the company. This time frame is known as deferred time\nGroup Life Insurance:\nGroup life insurance is a type of life insurance that covers a group of people. It is mostly provided by companies to its employees. As the insurance is done in a group, a group life insurance is considered cost-effective. The group can comprise lawyers, members of cooperative banks, societies, doctors, etc. \nLife Insurance for Senior Citizens:\nYou can brave various situations of life when you are young; however, in old age you need more protection and security. To manage such circumstances of life in old age, life insurance for senior citizens can be a good option. The insurance also provides financial coverage at times of need. For instance, in case you do not have any support for your spouse, life insurance for senior citizens can provide financial security to the spouse in case of your sudden demise. The death benefit can also be used to manage loans, debts and other financial needs.\n",

          "context": "43. PPF_AND_EPF\n\nPF is the popular name for EPF or Employees’ Provident Fund. It is a government-established savings scheme for employees of the organised sector. The EPF interest rate is declared every year by the EPFO (Employees Provident Fund Organisation) which is a statutory body under the Employees’ Provident Fund Act, 1956. For the current financial year, the interest rate on the EPF account has been fixed at 8.50%. Only employees of companies registered under the EPF Act can invest in the EPF or PF. Both the employer and employee are required to contribute 12% of the employee’s basic salary and dearness allowance every month to the EPF account. PPF or Public Provident Fund is a government-supported savings scheme. PPF is a long-term investment for a period of 15 years currently offered at an interest rate of 7.1% per annum (compounded yearly).  The maximum amount under this scheme is Rs.  1,50,000 in a financial year. Moreover, the deposit is qualified for deduction from income under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. PPF is a long-term investment for a period of 15 years currently offered at an interest rate of 7.1% per annum (compounded yearly). There is no minimum or maximum age of account opening. Investments are allowed with the minimum amount of Rs. 500 and maximum of Rs. 1.5 lakhs in a financial year. Investments can be made in lump sum or in 12 equal installments. Account can only be opened in a single holding form. You can invest in the name of minor also without exceeding your maximum limit of investment by combining balances of all your accounts. Maturity period can also be extended to 5 more years on completing the period of 15 years. You can keep extending maturity in blocks of five years, indefinitely. PPF is a pure long term investment plan with premature closure facility allowed only after 5 years from account opening and only for serious ailments or higher education. Partial withdrawal is also permissible after the expiry of 5 years from the end of the year in which the account is opened.\nBoth are safe due to statutory backing.  But EPF is riskier due to equity exposure in it. Both the EPF and PPF are government-backed savings instruments. The EPF is managed by a statutory body called the EPFO while the PPF is managed directly by the government. 15% of the fresh money collected by the EPFO every year is invested inequities. The rest is invested in government bonds.EPF is more liquid. Withdrawals from PPF are only allowed after the expiry of 5 years from account opening. You can withdraw 75% of your EPF corpus if you have been unemployed for a period of one month. If your unemployment extends to two months, you can withdraw the entire EPF corpus. However, note that if you withdraw your EPF corpus within 5 years of account opening, the withdrawal will be taxable. You can also simply leave the money in the EPF account even if you become unemployed or take up self-employment or work in the unorganised sector. In this case, the EPF balance will continue to earn interest but the same will be taxable. After three years, the account will stop earning interest. The EPF retirement age is 58. Upon attaining this age, you can withdraw most of your corpus. However, a portion of the EPF corpus which is used for the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) will be paid to you as pension and the same will be taxable. In the case of PPF, you cannot withdraw money due to unemployment. PPF accounts have a term of 15 years. You can make partial withdrawals from PPF after the expiry of 6 years and the start of the 5th year from the year of account opening but you do not have to give any reason for the same. You can also get a loan against the balance in the PPF account from the 3rd to the 6th year after account opening. The maximum amount of loan that can be availed against PPF accounts is 25% of the balance at the end of the 2nd financial year preceding the year in which the loan was applied for. PPF withdrawal is not taxable.\nEPF withdrawal becomes taxable if withdrawn before 5 years of completed service. Investment in the EPF qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. This applies to both the employer and employee contribution. Interest on the EPF is also exempt from tax unless you become unemployed. Withdrawals from the EPF are also free from tax unless you make them within 5 years of opening the EPF account. If the withdrawal amount within 5 years from the date of opening the EPF account is more than Rs 50,000, TDS is deducted from the same.\nInvestment in the PPF account up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum gets you a tax deduction under Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The interest on the PPF is also exempt from tax but must be declared in the annual income tax return. The PPF maturity amount is also exempt from tax. In other words, PPF enjoys ‘exempt, exempt, exempt’ tax treatment.\n",

Mutual fund, unlike stocks, do not invest only in a particular share. Instead, a mutual fund plan would invest across several investment options to provide investors with the best possible returns. The price of the fund unit of a mutual fund is referred to as the net asset value (NAV). It is the price at which you buy or sell fund units of a mutual fund scheme. The NAV of a mutual fund is calculated by dividing the total worth of assets in the portfolio, minus liabilities. All mutual fund units are sold and bought at the prevailing NAV of the mutual fund.\nMutual fund investment are handled by Experts called Fund Managers. Fund managers manage the investments pooled by the asset management companies (AMCs) or fund houses. These are finance professionals who have an excellent track record of managing investment portfolios. Furthermore, fund managers are backed by a team of analysts and experts who pick the best-performing stocks and assets that have the potential to provide excellent returns for investors in the long run. Most mutual funds come with no lock-in period. In investments, the lock-in period is a period over which the investments once made cannot be withdrawn. Some investments allow premature withdrawals within the lock-in period in exchange for a penalty. Only ELSS mutual funds come with a lock-in period.\nInvesting in mutual funds comes at a low cost, and thereby making it suitable for small investors. Mutual fund houses or asset management companies (AMCs) levy a small amount referred to as the expense ratio on investors to manage their investments. It generally ranges between 0.5% to 1.5% of the total amount invested. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEB) has mandated the expense ratio to be under 2.5%.\nThe most significant advantage of investing in mutual funds is that you can invest a small amount regularly via a SIP (systematic investment plan). The frequency of your SIP can be monthly, quarterly, or bi-annually, as per your comfort. Mutual fund comes with a Switch Fund Option. If you would like to move your investments to a different fund of the same fund house, then you have an option to switch your investments to that fund from your existing fund. Unlike stocks, mutual funds invest across asset classes and shares of several companies, thereby providing you with the benefit of diversification. Also, this reduces the concentration risk to a great extent. If one asset class fails to perform up to the expectations, then the other asset classes would make up for the losses. The combination of investing via an SIP and no lock-in period has made mutual funds an even more lucrative investment option. Since most mutual funds come with no lock-in period, it provides investors with a high degree of liquidity. On placing the redemption request, the fund house or the asset management company would credit your money to your bank account in just business 3-7 days. \nAll mutual fund houses and mutual fund plans are always under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Reserve Bank of India(RBI). \nELSS or Equity-Linked Savings Scheme is an equity-oriented mutual fund which provides tax deductions of up to Rs 1,50,000 a year under the Section 80C provision. By making full utilisation of the Section 80C limit, you can save up to Rs 46,800 a year in taxes. ELSS is the most popular tax-saving investment option under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. It comes with a lock-in period of just three years, the shortest of all tax-saving investments. On investing in mutual funds via an SIP, you get the benefit of rupee cost averaging over time. When the markets fall, you buy more units while you purchase fewer units when the markets are booming. Therefore, over time, your cost of purchase of fund units is averaged out. This is called the rupee cost averaging. \nThere are three primary ways through which investment is made in mutual funds, they are as follows:\nIn Direct Investment Investors have the option to invest on their own by contacting mutual fund companies and applying for schemes. Direct investment helps in saving of brokerage fees, and the investment process is fairly simple. All you have to do is visit a branch of the mutual fund company or download the form online from the website of the Asset Management Company. If you wish to invest directly, make sure you read through the fine print carefully and resolve all your queries before investing.\nMost investors take the online route to make investments in mutual funds. Not only does this help in saving time but also makes it very simple to compare various schemes before you make an informed investment decision. BankBazaar is one of the many portals in India that offer some of the best mutual funds in India. All you have to do is enter a few details and your investment process will be complete in a matter of minutes.\nProfessional agents can be hired to make informed investment decisions. Agents have comprehensive knowledge about mutual funds and know the best schemes to invest in to achieve your investment objectives. They invest your money based on your risk profile, investment goals, and your income. They take care of everything and charge a fee for the services they render.",

Investing in mutual funds is an excellent way to accomplish your goals faster. There are mutual fund plans that suit all personas. Investors need to assess their risk profile, investment horizon, and goals before getting started with their mutual fund investment. For example, if you are risk-averse and planning to purchase a car in five years, then you may consider investing in gilt funds. If you are ready to take some risk and are planning to buy a house in a period of fifteen to twenty years, then you may consider investing in equity funds. If your investment horizon is less than two years and you are looking to earn higher returns than a regular savings bank account, then you may consider parking your surplus funds in a liquid fund. Unlike stocks, you need not wait for any particular time to invest in mutual funds. This is because the fund managers and his team of analysts pick only the right securities and assets at all times and are going to benefit the investors, regardless of the market condition. Also, if you are investing via an SIP, then you are going to benefit from both down and high market cycles. When the markets are down, you end up buying more fund units as the stock prices would have fallen to their fresh lows, and when the markets shoot up, you buy lesser units. This is called the rupee cost averaging. This benefit is available only in the case of investing in mutual funds via SIP. All individuals who have completed their KYC process are eligible to invest in mutual funds. However, some fund houses don’t accept investments from NRIs living in the United States and Canada due to the FACTA regulations.\nDividends offered by all mutual funds are now taxed classically. They are added to your overall income and taxed as per your income tax slab. Capital gains offered by mutual funds are taxed based on the holding period and their type. The holding period is the duration over which you have stayed invested in a mutual fund.\nEquity Funds:\nIf you exit an equity fund within a holding period of one year, then you make short-term capital gains. These gains are taxed at a flat rate of 15%. You make long-term capital gains on exiting an equity fund after a holding period of one year. Long-term capital gains of up to Rs 1 lakh a year are made tax-exempt. Any long-term gains exceeding Rs 1 lakh a year are taxed at a flat rate of 10%, and there is no benefit of indexation provided.\nDebt Funds:\nYou make short-term capital gains on exiting a debt fund holding within three years. These gains are added to your overall income and taxed as per your income tax slab. Long-term capital gains are realised on redeeming your debt fund holdings after three years. These gains are taxed at the rate of 20% after indexation.\nHybrid or Balanced Funds:\nIf the equity exposure of a hybrid is more than 65%, then the fund is taxed like an equity fund. If not, then the rules of taxation of debt funds apply. Therefore, you need to be aware of the equity exposure before you decide to invest in a hybrid fund to plan your taxes correctly.\nTaxation in Mutual Funds:\nYou can save up to Rs 46,800 a year in taxes by investing in equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS), the best tax-saving investment under Section 80C. The asset allocation of ELSS mutual funds is primarily made towards equity and equity-linked securities. ELSS mutual funds are the best tax-saving investment under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. They come with a lock-in period of just three years, the shortest among all tax-saving investments. These mutual funds have the potential to provide returns in the range of 12% to 15%.\nELSS funds are the only tax-saving investment with the potential to offer inflation-beating returns. Therefore, investing in ELSS mutual funds gives you the twin benefits of tax deductions and wealth creation over time. Mutual funds don’t invest only in stocks. Only equity funds invest in stocks, while debt funds and liquid funds hardly invest in stocks. In fact, there are some debt funds that don’t invest in stocks at all. Exit load is the penalty charged by the fund house if you are not able to stay invested over a particular time frame. Most mutual funds are open-ended and come with no exit load. Investors should read the fund offer carefully before investing. The expense ratio is the fee charged by the fund houses to manage the investments of the investors. It is always less than 2.5% of the amount invested by the investors.\n",

          "context": "49. ELSS\n\nELSS mutual funds are managed by experienced finance professionals called fund mangers and are offered by almost all the fund houses in India. ELSS mutual funds are the only class of mutual funds eligible for tax deductions. You can save up to Rs 46,800 (tax deductions of up to Rs 1,50,000) a year in taxes by investing in ELSS, which is covered under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, you can invest more than this designated amount, but the excess over Rs 1.5 lakh will not qualify you to avail the tax benefits as per the provisions of Section 80C. The returns generated from ELSS are taxable with the dividend distribution tax (DDT) and taxes on Capital Gains (LTCG). ELSS Funds are a class of mutual funds that are eligible for tax deductions under the provisions of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. These mutual funds are equity-oriented and invest up to 65% of their portfolio in instruments such as shares. An ELSS fund gives you the dual benefit of tax deductions and wealth creation over time. Types of ELSS are Growth fund and Dividend Reinvestment. Growth Fund is long-term wealth creation platform for investors where the full value of the fund is realised at the time of redemption. Dividend Payout has two sub-categories, Dividend Payout and Dividend Reinvestment. Under the Dividend Payout option, you will receive tax-free dividends. In the case of Dividend Reinvestment, your dividends will be reinvested as a new investment.\nELSS mutual funds are often the first point of engagement for investors when it comes to investing in equity-linked investments. Many equity investors start off their investments in equity-linked investment with these funds and then go on to investing in equity mutual fund schemes. It helps to build discipline, given that you can’t touch the fund for the lock-in period of three years. These funds also act as a strong shield to weather the volatility that may come with investing in stock markets. The scheme not only benefits from the market highs but also has provisions to lessen the impact of the lows. Since ELSS is an equity-oriented mutual fund, it essentially carries all the risks that any other equity fund plan. All ELSS mutual funds are affected by the market risk, volatility risk and concentration risk. You need to note that switching funds result in the redemption of the fund units you already hold. Also, switching of funds is allowed only between the funds offered by the same fund house. As per the SEBI’s mandate, a fund house cannot offer two different fund plans under the same category. Therefore, there is no switch option when it comes to ELSS as the same fund house cannot offer more than one ELSS fund plans. \nTax Saving ELSS:\nDespite the new tax regime, i.e. tax on Long-Term Capital Gains from ELSS, these funds, in the opinion of experts, still, hold their place as one of the best tax-saving options. ELSS can play a significant role in your portfolio. These equity-linked instruments have the potential to offer higher returns and are an ideal choice of investment for the long term. ELSS holds its ground, even with its returns being taxed, with higher post-tax returns than any other Section 80C investment options such as Public Provident Funds (PPFs) and ULIPS.\nGiven that ELSS invests predominantly in the equity instruments, the returns are much higher than most investment options with tax-saving benefits in the longer run. This serves two purposes; you not only save on taxes but also generate high returns/profits. ELSS can be the right choice for an individual who is willing to invest for a medium to long duration. Historical performance shows that ELSS generates about 12% over ten years and more. This, when compared to a mere 8% returns offered by PPF, is a significant gain. ELSS has a lower lock-in period. Unlike the PPF, NSC and EPF, all of which requires a minimum of five years lock-in period, ELSS is a far better option with just three years of lock-in.\nELSS and ULIP:\nIt is possible that your ULIPs, which were sold to you at a low cost through insurance firms directly, generate returns similar to that of an ELSS in the longer run. However, what a ULIP doesn’t offer is the flexibility of ELSS. If you are unhappy with your ELSS fund, then you may move to another fund as you are not required to commit to a multi-year deal. In the case of a ULIP, if you are unhappy with the fund, you can only shift and invest in funds that are offered by that ULIP.\nThe advantages of Combining ELSS and PPF:\nAnother clear advantage that ELSS enjoys over its counterparts is that it can be coupled with PPF for more significant benefits. This combination is a solid ground to uncover the stability offered by PPF and the earning potential of ELSS. If you see closely, you find out that there are further advantages to this arrangement; your portfolio is well diversified with a mix of debt and equity, you have the safety of government-backed securities with an opportunity to grow through equities.",

For senior citizens, the limit has been extended to ₹ 30,000. Additionally, preventive health check-up costs till ₹ 5000 per family qualify for tax deductions. Under Section 80DD, if a family member of the tax payer is suffering from 40% disability, he can claim deductions for up to ₹ 75,000 for spending on medical treatments for disabled dependents. Under Section 80DDB, a person is allowed deductions if he pays an amount of ₹ 40,000 or more on treatment of specific diseases which includes malignant cancers, neurological diseases, chronic renal failure, haematological disorders and AIDS. If you have taken an education loan and you are repaying the interest, you will qualify for income tax deductions under Section 80E. However, deductions are not allowed for repayment of the principal amount of the education loan. Under Section 80G, 80GGA, 80GGB, 80GGC, if a person has made donations to an approved body during a financial year, he will qualify for deductions.\nA standard deduction of ₹ 40,000 has been introduced in Budget 2018 for the salaried class in lieu of Medical Reimbursement and Transport allowance. This deduction is allowed irrespective of expenses incurred by the employee. The assessee does not have to submit actual bills to claim this deduction. Income tax rebate includes those items which can be claimed from the total tax payable. Tax deductions and tax exemptions are claimed from the income whereas in case of rebates, claims are made from the tax payable. \nYou can claim an Income Tax rebate under section 87A when you file the income tax returns. A rebate will be available if the tax payer is a resident individual who has not crossed the 80 year mark and whose taxable income is ₹ 5,00,000 or less. Hindu undivided Families, companies, trusts, LLP, partnership firms and NRIs are not eligible for tax rebate. As per the Income Tax Act, salaried employees are eligible for several income tax exemptions. It is necessary that the salaried employees intimate the employer that they are claiming these exemptions. While deducting the TDS, the employer would then compute the tax on the balance income. Let’s take a look at the tax deductions in details: Most employers give their employees a house rent allowance. As per the Income Tax Act, a portion of the HRA is exempted from tax. Some employers also give special allowance to the employees. A certain part of this amount is exempted from tax provided the vacation was within India. In most cases, employees are eligible for leaves when they serve an organization. When they do not claim these leaves, they can encash these leaves. The amount which is received as leave encashment can also be claimed as exemption. Up to a certain limit, tax exemption is also given on pensions.\nAt times, some employees opt for a voluntary retirement (VRS) before the age of retirement. In such cases, the employer pays out an amount of money to the employee. This amount received by the employee in the event of VRS is exempted from tax. Tax evasion is termed as an illegal activity which includes not filing the income tax returns or misrepresenting the tax amount which needs to be paid. The penalty can go up to almost three times the amount which has been concealed. ",

          "context": "57. BANKING_OMBUDSMAN\n\nThe RBI Banking Ombudsman Scheme was created in 2006 to enable people/customers to file their complaints to resolve banking issues they face. The main objective of this scheme is to enable resolution of complaints relating to certain services rendered by banks and to facilitate the satisfaction or settlement of such complaints. The Banking Ombudsman is a person appointed by the Reserve Bank of India, who has quasi-judicial (tribunal board which has legal powers) authority. All commercial banks, regional rural banks, co-operative banks, and public sector and nationalised banks are covered under the Ombudsman scheme. In fact, many popular banks like SBI have set up a dedicated system to address online complaints. Presently, there are 15 banking Ombudsmen who have been appointed with offices, most of which are in the state capitals.\nYou can approach the RBI Banking Ombudsman to register a complaint under the following categories:\nNon-payment or inordinate delay in the payment or collection of cheques, drafts, bills etc. Non-acceptance, without sufficient cause, of small denomination notes tendered for any purpose, and for charging of commission in respect thereof. Non-acceptance, without sufficient cause, of coins tendered and for charging of commission in respect thereof. Non-payment or delay in payment of inward remittances. Failure to issue or delay in issue of drafts, pay orders or bankers’ cheques. Non-adherence to prescribed working hours. Failure to provide or delay in providing a banking facility (other than loans and advances) promised in writing by a bank or its direct selling agents. Delays, non-credit of proceeds to parties’ accounts, non-payment of deposits or non-observance of the Reserve Bank directives, if any, applicable to rate of interest on deposits in any savings, current or other accounts maintained with a bank. Complaints from Non-Resident Indians having accounts in India in relation to their remittances from abroad, deposits and other bank-related matters. Refusal to open deposit accounts without any valid reason for refusal. Levying of charges without adequate prior notice to the customer. Non-adherence by the bank or its subsidiaries to the instructions of Reserve Bank on ATM/Debit Card operations or Credit Card operations. Non-disbursement or delay in disbursement of pension (to the extent the grievance can be attributed to the action on the part of the bank concerned, but not with regard to its employees). Refusal to accept or delay in accepting payment towards taxes, as required by Reserve Bank/Government. Refusal to issue or delay in issuing, or failure to service or delay in servicing or redemption of Government securities. Forced closure of deposit accounts without due notice or without sufficient reason. Refusal to close or delay in closing the accounts. Non-adherence to the fair practices code as adopted by the bank or non-adherence to the provisions of the Code of Banks Commitments to Customers issued by Banking Codes and Standards Board of India and as adopted by the bank. Non-observance of Reserve Bank guidelines on the engagement of recovery agents by banks. Any other matter relating to the violation of the directives issued by the Reserve Bank in relation to banking or other services.\nA customer can also lodge a complaint on the following grounds of deficiency in service with respect to loans and advances. Non-observance of Reserve Bank Directives on interest rates. Delays in sanction, disbursement or non-observance of prescribed time schedule for disposal of loan applications. Non-acceptance of application for loans without furnishing valid reasons to the applicant. Non-adherence to the provisions of the fair practices code for lenders as adopted by the bank or Code of Bank’s Commitment to Customers, as the case may be. Non-observance of any other direction or instruction of the Reserve Bank as may be specified by the Reserve Bank for this purpose from time to time.\nThe Banking Ombudsman may also deal with such other matter as may be specified by the Reserve Bank from time to time.You can approach the banking ombudsman if You have not received a reply from your bank within one month from the date of receipt of a complaint by the bank or The bank has rejected your complaint or You are not satisfied with bank’s reply.\nThe present complaint cannot be reported to the banking Ombudsman by either party. In other words, you cannot re-register a complaint if you have received an answer already. The present complaint has not been settled through the Office of the Banking Ombudsman in any previous proceeding. The subject matter has not already been decided by any forum/court/arbitrator. The RBI Banking Ombudsman does not charge any fee for resolving customers’ complaints. The best way forward is to settle things amicably with the bank. After all, banks need their customers and will ensure that they resolve issues, especially if there is a written complaint.\n",

POST_OFFICE_SAVINGS_ACCOUNTS\n\nPost Office Savings Account is like a savings account with a bank, except that it is held with a post office.Only one account can be opened with one post office and can be transferred from one post office to another. You can also open an account in the name of a minor. The interest rate is 4% and is fully taxable. However, no TDS is deducted on the same. Under the non-cheque facility, the minimum balance which is required to be maintained is Rs.50/-. However a deduction of Rs 10,000 per annum is available on your total savings account interest including post office savings interest under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\nPost Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS):\nUnique scheme which offers guaranteed fixed monthly income on the lump sum investment made by the investor. A minor can also invest in this scheme. If the minor is of more than 10 years, then he can even operate the account. The minimum limit for investment is Rs. 1500 and the maximum investment limit is Rs. 4.5 lakhs in a single holding account and Rs. 9 lakhs for joint accounts under the Monthly Income Scheme of Post Office. Currently, the MIS interest rate in the post office is 6.6% per annum payable monthly with a maturity period of 5 years. The amount so received monthly can also be further invested in post office recurring deposits. Investors can hold multiple accounts with a maximum investment of Rs. 4.5 lakh by combining balances in all the accounts. Joint accounts will have equal shares from all holders. There is no TDS on the interest payout and deposits are exempt from wealth tax. This Scheme is a preferable choice for risk-averse investors looking for regular monthly income.\nPost Office Recurring Deposit:\nPost office RD is basically a monthly investment for a fixed period of 5 years with an interest rate of 5.8% per annum (compounded quarterly). There is a default fee of 5 paise for every 5 rupees in case if you miss on any monthly investment. The account offers flexibility by allowing a partial withdrawal up to 50% of the balance after a year. There is no TDS on interest from post office RD. \nPost Office Time Deposit:\nThe minimum amount that can be invested is Rs. 200. There is no upper limit. There is no restriction on the number of accounts one can hold. Once the time deposit is matured, it will automatically renew for the same tenure again with the prevailing rate of interest on the day of maturity. There is a tax benefit for the investment made in the 5-year post office time deposit. The investment qualifies for the deduction under Section 80C of The Income Tax Act, 1961.\nThe schedule fee of Post office Investment Schemes are as follows:\nRs. 50 is charged for the duplicate issued passbook. The deposit receipt or the issue of statement of account is charged at Rs. 20 in each case. Issue of passbook in lieu of lost or mutilated certificate  is charged at Rs. 10 per registration. In case of the cancellation or change of nomination, the charges are Rs. 50. The fee for the account transfer is Rs. 100. The pledging of account is charged at  Rs. 100. In case the cheque book is issued in savings bank account there is no fee for up to 10 leafs in a calendar year and thereafter at Rs. 2 per cheque leaf. The charges on dishonour of cheque is Rs. 100.\n",

Long term returns from shares can range up to 16%, thus allowing you the opportunity of wealth creation. But, it has been historically proved that stock markets offer the best returns. You must, however, understand the basics of the stock market before investing your hard-earned money in shares. Investment in shares is often fraught with the risk of high market volatility, and expertise in the market will prevent you from taking unnecessary risks.\nAdvantages of Investing in Share Market:\nAfter understanding the demat account and its functioning, it’s important to know about stock trading and its benefits. Many people perceive stock market as a game of cards and they buy and sell shares according to their intuition. However, investing in the stock market is more than that. It can be your secondary or even primary source of earning if managed properly. Here are some benefits of investing in the stock/share market.This can be your best chance to grow your money as fast as you can. Even if the stock prices rise and fall every day. The overall value of stock market rises eventually. Investments made in stable and reliable companies always grow and tend to make good money. In addition, investing in different types of stocks allows you to target various sectors and leverage growth. This can be a good deal even if some of your stocks lose their value. Some stocks offer income in the form of dividends. These deliver annual payments to investors based on the dividend declared by the company on its shares. Dividends can help you build retirement corpus or grow your investment. A stock market investment always offers diversified investment for investors. Share prices keep moving up and down and this means you ought to have a diversified portfolio of stocks so you do not lose any money in case one or two of your stocks lose ground on prices due to performance of the company or of the industry, or for any other reason. Shares or stock means you have an ownership of the chosen company. This can be a huge benefit since a profitable and stable company means that you can always earn money through these stocks. Owning a stock in the company you work also expresses your loyalty to the company and binds your personal finances to the success of the business as a whole. In the present digital age, you can purchase shares online at the click of a mouse. \nSteps required to buy shares online:\nObtaining a Permanent Account Number (PAN) is the first step towards any trade in the stock markets. According to government regulations, you have to provide your PAN before making any financial transactions. PAN is a 10-digit unique alphanumeric number allotted to you. A PAN card also acts as a valid identity proof. PAN is used by the government to assess your tax liability. Before purchasing shares online, you have to compulsorily open a Demat Account. A demat account is opened by the investor at the time of registering with the investment broker or sub-broker. This account is preferred for trading (buying and selling of stocks) to enable electronic settlements. Your demat account holds all your shares and investments in an electronic or dematerialised form. It holds all your government securities, bonds, shares, mutual funds, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). A Demat account is also known as a Dematerialized account. Here, the physical shares held by you are dematerialized or converted in an electronic format.The number of shares purchased or sold is accordingly credited or debited in your account. Here, you must remember that you can only open a Demat Account with a Depository Participant (DP). A DP can either be registered with National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) or Central Securities Depositories Limited (CSDL), or both. Banks always credit your demat account right on the day of purchase of shares. They also credit your savings account on the 3rd day after you sell your shares. A demat account can be opened with no shares at all. It does not require any minimum balance. \nA trading account is used to purchase and sell shares in stock markets. Once you have a Demat Account, and want to purchase shares online, you need to open a Trading Account. While purchasing shares online, you have to quote your unique Trading Account number. As you cannot purchase shares directly from stock markets, you have to use the services of a broker. Register with a Broker or Brokerage Platform. A broker is a financial intermediary, acting as the link between you and the stock market. Market regulator, Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) certifies brokers in India.\nYou cannot purchase shares online without having a bank account. Your Trading Account links your Demat Account with your bank account. If you want to purchase online shares, then you have to make the requisite order through your Trading Account. The broker will then forward the transaction for settlement in the stock exchange. Post settlement, the shares will be transferred to your Demat Account within two working days, while the necessary charges, or purchase costs, will be debited from your bank account. To create a database of all Market Participants and investors, SEBI has made it compulsory for investors to get a Unique Identification Number or UIN. You can get a UIN through Point of Service (POS) agents appointed by NSDL. You must, however, note that a UIN is only required when you are trading in capital of Rs 1 lakh or more. If you want to purchase online shares below the amount of Rs 1 lakh, you don’t require UIN. After following the five steps listed above, you are now all set to purchase shares online. ",

This limit exceeds to ₹ 3,00,000 for senior citizens and ₹ 5,00,000 for citizens who are above 80 years. Senior Citizens aged 75 years and above were however exempted from filing income tax if their only source of income was through a pension.The income tax slab rates For assessment year 2021-2022 are \nTax rate for Above Rs.2.50 to Rs.5 lak is 5% of the total income that is more than Rs.2.5 lakh. \nTax rate for Above Rs.5 lakh to  Rs.7.50 lakh is 10% of the total income that is more than Rs.5 lakh + Rs.12,500. \nTax rate for Above Rs.7.50 lakh to Rs.10 lakh is 15% of the total income that is more than Rs.7.5 lakh + Rs.37,500.\nTax rate for Above Rs.10 lakh to Rs.12.50 lakh is 20% of the total income that is more than Rs.10 lakh + Rs.75,000\nTax rate for Above Rs.12.50 -to Rs.15 lakh is 25% of the total income that is more than Rs.12.5 lakh + Rs.1,25,000\nTax rate for Above Rs.15 lakh is 30% of the total income that is more than Rs.15 lakh + Rs.1,87,500\nFor income Between ₹ 50 Lakhs to ₹ 1 Crore a surcharge of 10% of the income tax has to be paid as well.\nFor income Above ₹ 1 Crore a surcharge of 15% of the income tax has to be paid.\n4% of the income tax has to be paid as Health and Education Cess by all taxpayers irrespective of the slab they fall into.\nA tax of flat 30% is computed on the total income and a surcharge of 7% is levied on domestic companies if their total income exceeds ₹ 1 Crore.\nA surcharge of 12% is levied on domestic companies if their total income exceeds ₹ 10 Crore. An education cess of 3% of tax plus surcharge is also charged from such entities\nThe ITR (Income Tax Return Form) summarizes income earned in a particular financial year. The income can be from business, salary, pension, income from housing property, or even income from capital gains, other income such as lottery and other legal gambling, dividend income, etc. As per the Income Tax Act, it is mandatory to file ITR every year. A credit card will not be issued by the bank till an applicant files his returns regularly. For the first time in the year 2006-2007, the e-filing facility was introduced by the Income Tax Department. You can e-file your income tax returns at https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/. The final tax which is payable is calculated by applying the tax rates which are in force and then by deducting the taxes which have been paid through TDS (tax deduction at source). To save the maximum amount of tax, it is necessary that you examine the deductions which have been defined under the different sections of IT Act, 1961. Certain investment avenues such as National Savings Certificate and Public Provident Fund are eligible for deduction under section 80C of the IT Act 1961. However, most tax payers tend to ignore a range of investment avenues which are eligible for tax concessions. \nDifference between TDS and Tax:\nYou are eligible to get an income tax refund from the government if you have paid taxes in excess of your financial liability for the applicable financial year. Your applicable refund amount will be calculated at the time of filing ITR and credited to you as and when the refund has been processed by the income tax authorities.\nProfessional tax is a state level tax applied on the income earned by individuals within the specific state. Currently professional tax is applicable only to individuals located in specific states in India that collect professional tax and the rate of professional tax as well as exemption limit varies from state to state. It is also notable that the amount paid in lieu of professional tax gets deducted from income tax liability of the tax assessee at the time of Income Tax filing.\nDifference between Income Tax and Income Tax Return:\nIncome tax is the tax payable by an individual/firm/group for the income earned by them during the applicable financial year. On the other hand, income tax return is an annual record of income earned, tax liability, tax paid, investment made, etc. during the applicable year. This record is to be submitted to the applicable tax authorities in a prescribed format known as the income tax return form. This process of submitting the income tax return form is known as income tax return filing. A duty is also a type of tax however it is only applicable to imports/exports. ",

Your money is safe in a bank account. Even if somehow the bank gets robbed, you will still get your money as the Government guarantees investments in banks up to Rs. 1 lakh. Plus, banks also insure themselves. As per the new RBI mandate, interest on savings account is calculated on a daily basis based on your closing amount. The interest accumulated will be credited to your account on half yearly basis or quarterly basis depending on the savings account type and the bank’s rule. However, recently, the Reserve Bank of India has advised the banks to credit the interest on Savings Bank account on quarterly basis as it will be more beneficial to the customers. \nTDS on Savings Account Interest :\nInterest earnings of up to Rs.10000 accrued on your savings account balance is tax free under Section 80TTA.

This interest must be filed for Income Tax Returns. But, TDS is not applicable for a savings account as per section 194 A of IT Act . Savings Bank Account Interest amount exceeding Rs. 10, 000 will be taxed at marginal tax rate of the concerned account holder. It is also important to note that interest from a savings account is not an exemption but a deduction. The deduction is allowed for interest incomes up to Rs. 10, 000 only and for this purpose, the savings account must be held with a recognized public or private bank or with the Post Office. You can deposit funds either by cash or cheques into the savings account or can transfer funds from other savings account using IMPS/NEFT/RTGS/UPI and earn interest on such deposits, which is credited to your account on a quarterly basis. It may take up to three working days for the money to reach your account after you deposit a cheque. When you open a savings account, the bank will give you a pass book to track your deposits and withdrawals. If you open a savings bank account and are able to sign (as against using a thumb print), most banks give you the option of using a debit card. A debit card allows you to withdraw money from their Automated Teller Machines (ATM) any time of the night or day, all through the year. ATM Debit cards carry an annual fee of approximately Rs.150 plus applicable taxes (varies from one bank to another). However, many private sector banks waive the annual fee provided you use your Debit card for shopping transactions of a specified denomination during the year or you maintain the minimum average balance requirement specified by the bank.\nSalary account: \nIt is opened as per the tie-up between your employer and the bank. This is the account, where salaries of every employee are credited to a Fixed Deposits are one of the safest and most popular investment instrument among Senior Citizens.

Employees can pick their type of salary account based on the features they want. The bank, where you have a salary account, also maintains reimbursement accounts; this is where your allowances and reimbursements are credited to. \nNRI Account:\nThere are different types of bank accounts for Indians or Indian-origin people living overseas. These accounts are called overseas accounts. Non-resident ordinary (NRO) savings accounts or fixed deposit accounts are rupee accounts. When NRIs deposit money in these accounts, usually in foreign currency, it is converted into INR at the prevailing exchange rate. NRIs can park money earned in India or overseas in NRO bank accounts. The income earned on these deposit accounts is taxed. Non-resident external (NRE) savings accounts or fixed deposit accounts are similar to NRO accounts and the funds in these accounts are maintained in INR. But, the interest earned on these deposit accounts is not taxed in India. Foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) account are maintained in foreign currency. The principal and interest from these accounts are transferable, but the interest earned is not taxed in India.\n",

          "context": "8. OPEN_A_BANK_ACCOUNT\n\nTo open a bank account in India, an applicant needs to own a list of documents that are outlined by all state-owned and private banks in India as must-haves to meet the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. The first step is to apply for your Aadhaar card, if you don’t have one already. A verifiable 12-digit identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India , the Aadhaar card has become the single valid proof of identity, proof of residence and proof of the bank account holder’s phone number. This appointment for Aadhaar enrolment can help you enrol for a fresh Aadhaar card and also help you update your name, address, mobile number, email address, date of birth and biometric information. Any incorrect information can stall your bank account opening process; hence, it is paramount that all information is verified and rechecked before applying for a new bank account. You will need your enrolment ID (EID) to check your Aadhaar status. The EID is displayed on the top of your enrolment/update acknowledgement slip and contains a 14-digit enrolment number and the 14-digit date and time of enrolment. These 28 digits together form your EID. In case you are unable to recall your EID, you can retrieve a lost or forgotten EID by your registered mobile number. \nThe Permanent Account Number, or PAN, is a 10-digit unique alphanumeric number issued by the Income Tax Department of India. PAN enables the tax department to identify and link all transactions such as tax payments, returns of income and specified transactions of the PAN holder. It is mandatory to produce your PAN card at the time of application for a new bank account. The Income Tax department has allowed UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Limited (UTIITSL) or the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) to manage PAN Service centres.  A person who is a citizen of India can apply for a PAN via Form 49A, and a non-resident person, including a foreign company, must apply for a PAN via Form 49AA. You can apply for a PAN card online by visiting the NSDL website. While the Aadhaar Card, as well as the PAN card, are mandatory to create a bank account, other documents that can be used include a driving licence, the applicant’s passport, his or her voter’s ID and the ration card, which is issued by the government of India to enable citizens to purchase subsidized food grain via the Public Distribution System. \nSteps to Open a Bank Account:\nTo open any type of bank account, you need to visit the bank’s branch or visit the bank’s website to procure the bank account opening form.  Fill personal details such as your name, permanent address, date of birth, the names of parents or spouse, along with your signatures to commit to basic terms and conditions of the bank. Submit Documents of Proof for KYC. Indian banks have been mandated by the central bank Reserve Bank of India to authorise the opening of a bank account only when certain documents are produced as proof of identity. In the case of opening a new account, customers need to submit mandatory documents such as an Aadhaar Card or PAN Card, and submit two recent photos of themselves. Other documents of proof will vary from one bank to another. \nBanks usually take one to two days for new account approvals. Collect Your Account Details, Debit Card and Internet Banking Details. Once the bank approves your account-opening documents by analysing the proofs submitted, new account opening is sanctioned and the bank issues you your bank account number, along with a customer ID to enable online banking. Online banking is a way to carry out banking transactions electronically using the internet, instead of making in-person transactions at a physical bank branch. A debit card is a plastic card issued by your bank to enable you to make payments using the card instead of paying in cash. As a mandatory requirement, you are expected to change your ATM pin by visiting a bank ATM and selecting a new pin for your debit card. \nDifferent Options for Operating a Bank Account:\n‘Mode of operation’ refers to how a bank account is operated. Any account can be opened by an individual alone or together with two or more individuals. When there are more than one account holder, customers can choose different kinds of modes of operation such as singly, either or survivor and jointly. When there are two holders in an account and any one of the holders can perform financial transactions in an account independently, then the mode of operation is known as ‘either or Survivor’. In case there are more than two holders, this   mode of operation is called ‘anyone or Survivor’. Customers can also stipulate a clause where unless two holders sign together, a transaction cannot be carried out in the account. This mode of operation is known as ‘Jointly’.\n",

          "context": "9. LOANS_AND_ADVANCES\n\nLoans are important financial tools which can help you make purchases, address need for funds during an emergency or to create an asset like buying a home. Broadly loans are of three types- personal loans, home loans and automobile loans. Business loans include Working Capital Loan, Term Loan (Short & Long-term Loan), Letter of Credit, Bill/Invoice Discounting, Overdraft Facility, Equipment Finance or Machinery Loan, Loans under Govt. schemes, POS Loans or Merchant Cash Advance. Interest can be calculated on a daily, monthly, quarterly or annual basis. The outstanding principal loan at the end of each of these terms is taken into account for calculating the interest rate. Loans can be classified as secured or unsecured. Further, they can be based on fixed rate of interest or floating rate of interest. In case of secured loans, you are required to pledge your home or any other valuable security. In case of unsecured loans, there is no such requirement. Unsecured loans are for your short-term monetary requirements whereas secured loans can be taken for longer periods. The amount of loan that is available under unsecured category is limited, whereas, in case of secured loans, the loan amount can reach very high proportions depending upon the value of your home. You can take loans against securities or any other valuable asset that the bank is willing to accept.\nA secured loan is a loan given out by a financial institution wherein an asset is used as collateral or security for the loan. For example, you can use your house, gold, etc., to avail a loan amount that corresponds to the asset’s value. In the case of a secured loan, the bank or financial institution that is dispensing the loan will hold on to the ownership deed of the asset until the loan is paid off.\nExamples of secured loans are Loan against property, Home equity line of credit, Car loan. Unsecured loan is a loan that is not secured by a collateral such as land, gold, etc. These loans are comparatively riskier to a lender and therefore associated with a high interest rate. When a lender releases an unsecured loan, he does so after evaluating your financial status and assessing whether or not you are capable of repaying your loan. Examples of unsecured loans are Credit cards, Personal loans, Student loans.\nCollateral Security:\nIn lending agreements, collateral is a borrower’s pledge of specific property to a lender, to secure repayment of a loan. The collateral serves as protection for a lender against a borrower’s default - that is, any borrower failing to pay the principal and interest under the terms of a loan obligation. If a borrower does default on a loan (due to insolvency or other event), that borrower forfeits (gives up) the property pledged as collateral - and the lender then becomes the owner of the collateral. In a typical mortgage loan transaction, for instance, the real estate being acquired with the help of the loan serves as collateral. Should the buyer fail to pay the loan under the mortgage loan agreement, the ownership of the real estate is transferred to the bank. The bank uses a legal process called foreclosure to obtain real estate from a borrower who defaults on a mortgage loan obligation. A home loan is a secured loan. In case of a home loan, the home acts as a collateral and can be seized by the bank or lending company in case of a default in loan repayment. A personal loan, on the other hand, is an unsecured loan. Hence, in case of a personal loan, there is no collateral requirement\nEquated Monthly Instalments (EMI):\nEMI stands for “Equated Monthly Instalments”. When you take a loan, the amount to be repaid every month is calculated in such a way that all your outstanding dues are cleared at the end of the loan period. This monthly payment that includes interest as well as the principal amount is called an EMI. Loan repayment is generally made with the help of Post Dated Cheques or through Electronic Clearance System (ECS) that is directly linked to your bank account. In case of Electronic Clearance System, repayment is deducted automatically from your bank account on an agreed date. Loans are available in the Indian market for a period starting from 6 months to 25 years. The exact duration depends upon which loan plan you have chosen, and it generally varies from bank to bank.",

Composite Loan is a perfect financing solution for individuals who want to buy a plot of land either for investment or for building a house.

Minimum Salary should be at least Rs. 25,000 per month. Loan Amount is given Up to 90% of property value. Apart from these, your home loan eligibility also depends on the property you are buying and the location of the property.\nFinancial institutions lend 75-90% of the property value. This implies that the remaining 10-25% of the property value has to be contributed as down-payment by borrowers. You can get the cheapest home loan interest rate if you apply for a home loan jointly with your wife and make her the primary applicant of your home loan. Most of the banks provide interest concession home loans to women on an interest rate which is less than 0.5% of the general home loan interest rate.\nHome loan balance transfer is the Transfer of the outstanding balance of your existing home loan to another bank or from one lender to another.

          "context": "15. LOAN_AGAINST_PROPERTY \n\nThis scheme is a secured personal loan which you can avail by pledging your property as a security or a collateral. These personal loan schemes are also known as mortgage loans. Loan against Property interest rates range between 8.00% p.a. to 25% p.a. You can avail loans of up to Rs.25 crore for a tenure of up to 20 years with LAP. Loan Against Property (LAP), also known as mortgage loan, is sanctioned against an asset, which remains with a lender until the loan is repaid. This asset can be a residential, commercial or industrial property. Property loan gives you access to high loan amount at a low interest rate starting at 8.20% p.a. Lenders usually sanction a mortgage loan between 50% and 70% of the property’s market value, which you can repay easily in EMIs stretching up to 20 years. Like unsecured personal loans, LAP Loan or loan against property also can be availed for meeting both personal and business needs other than speculative purposes.\nBenefits of loan against property:\nLike personal loan, loan against property can be used for both personal and business purposes other than any speculative use. Mortgage loan is secured against a high value asset, which gives you access to high loan amount, helping you meet your high-end expenses with ease. The interest rate on a secured loan is lower than the interest rate on an unsecured loan. This makes loan against property a cheaper and a better alternative to personal loans. The tenure of loan against property usually extends till 20 years, giving you the benefit of lower EMIs and greater flexibility of repayment. Mortgage loan also comes with the feature of balance transfer, allowing you to refinance your existing mortgage loan to another lender giving lower interest rate or better loan terms. Interest paid for the loan against property provides tax benefits under Section 37 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. If the loan amount is used for financing a new house purchase, the interest paid on the loan will get you tax benefit of up to Rs. 2 lakh under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act\nLoan Against Property Interest Rates:\nThe interest rate is a significant factor that affects the total cost of your property loan. As loan against property is of higher value and longer tenor, its rate of interest can have long-term financial implications on borrowers. Availing low-interest rates on loan against property will reduce the EMI as well as the total interest payout. Therefore, prospective borrowers should try to get a mortgage loan at the lowest possible rate of interest. Before applying for mortgage loan, use loan against property EMI calculator to know how much EMI you can afford on a certain loan amount, interest rate and tenure. Your loan against property EMI should not put strain on your monthly expenses. Once you find the EMI, loan amount and tenure that you are comfortable with, click the Apply Now button to proceed for the loan against property application process.\nLoan Against Property Documents Required:\nWhen applying for a mortgage loan, lenders ask for a list of documents to assess your loan repayment capacity and also to ensure that all information given by you is legit. Now this list of documents may differ from one lender to another. It may also vary as per your scheme, resident type and type of employment. However, the common set of documents required to apply for loan against property are \nDuly filled loan against property application form, Passport size photographs, Proof of Identity such as Passport Copy /Voter ID card /Driving License /PAN Card,  Proof of Residence such as Ration card /Telephone Bill /Electricity Bill /Rental agreement /Passport copy /Bank Passbook or Statement /Driving License, Proof of Age such as PAN Card /Passport /any other certificate from a statutory authority,\nBank Statements or Bank Passbook for the last 6 months OR Last 6 months salary slips, Form 16, Income Tax Returns for the last 3 years, Processing Fee Cheque, Documentation related to the property offered as collateral. Additional Documents Required for Mortgage Loan for self employed applicant is Income statements and other financials for the past 2 years attested by a CA and for SMEs is Audited financials for the last 2 years. The market value of a property is estimated in terms of money that it can raise if it is sold at prevailing conditions. Different lenders have different criteria for the type of property to be accepted against a mortgage loan. However, mostly all financial institutions accept the residential, commercial or industrial property. It is important to note that the physical condition and age of the property may affect its acceptance by the financial institution. Mostly, the tenure of a loan against property goes up to 15 years. In case of a LAP, the property used as collateral remains under your control.\n",

          "context": "17. BUSINESS_LOAN \n\nThe loan can be availed by self-employed professionals, self-employed non-professionals, and entities.

Minimum Annual Income (ITR) of Rs.1.5 lakh per annum is required. Applicants should be between the ages of 25 years and 55 years. The IT returns for the last 1 year should have been filed. Lenders may offer business loans to only certain cities and towns.\nDocuments Required for Business Loan includes PAN Card for company, firm or individual, Proof of ID, in the form of, copy of Aadhar Card, Passport copy, Voter’s ID copy, driving license, Proof of address, in the form of, copy of Aadhar Card, Passport copy, Voter’s ID copy, driving license, Bank statement of last 6 months, Latest ITR along with computation of income, balance sheet and P&L account for the last 2 years. All financials must be CA certified or audited, Proof of continuation  such as ITR/Trade License/Establishment/Sales Tax Certificate, Sole Proprietorship Declaration or certified copy of Partnership Deed, Certified true copy of Memorandum and Articles of Association.\nTYPES OF BUSINESS LOAN:\nIn an overdraft facility, the business owner can withdraw a larger sum than the amount present in the account as a loan to meet his or her business needs. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn and the interest rate under this facility is based on a mutual agreement between the lender and borrower. In case of a term loan, a borrower can avail a secured or unsecured loan to receive the funds according to the situation and requirement of the business. When an entrepreneur withdraws a demand loan to meet the financial requirements of his or her business, the amount has to be repaid whenever the bank or non-banking financing company (NBFC) recalls it. Demand loans can be both secured and unsecured and are ideal to meet a short-term financial crisis. While the maximum term for this type of a business loan can be 12 months, the merchant can choose to renew it when the term has ended. The cash credit facility is an overdraft loan that can be availed by a business to finance its need for working capital by offering its current assets such as receivables, inventory, etc. as collateral. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn using this scheme is dependent on the stock margin fixed by the bank. The tenure of this loan can be renewed at regular intervals of 12 months.\nLoan against securities:\nAt the time of a financial crisis, a business can also decide to opt for a loan against its financial securities that are approved by the bank such as mutual funds, fixed maturity plans, insurance policies, savings bonds, demat shares, exchange-traded funds, etc.\nLetter of credit facility:\nThis type of financing scheme can be availed by a business based on the creditworthiness of the buyer’s bank when the buyer and the seller do not know each other such as during international trade transactions. In this case, the bank pledges on-time payment to the seller after taking account of its origin certificate, insurance certificate, transportation documents, legal documents, and other commercial documents. However, if the buyer fails to make the payment, the bank is liable to pay the entire outstanding amount.\nBank guarantee:\nWhether you own a public/private limited company or proprietorship/partnership firm, you can avail this pre-approved secured loan by offering residential, commercial, or industrial property as collateral. This financing scheme helps companies secure down loans, buy the required equipment, or cover any additional costs that will help the organisation grow. In this kind of a business loan, the financing company promises to pay the stakeholders of the guaranteed business in case it defaults.",

          "context": "7. FIXED_AND_RECURRING_DEPOSIT\n\nFixed deposit or FD is an investment product offered by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). This allows customers to safely park their savings and earn interest at a fixed rate thus giving them the much sought-after stability. FD interest rate is higher than what customers get on depositing their money in a regular savings account. Fixed deposits are called term deposits in banking parlance since these deposits are maintained for a specific period (usually ranging from 7 days to 10 years). \nFixed deposits features and benefits;\t\nFD provides guaranteed returns on investments and is always risk-free. It is because the FD interest rates are not market-influenced but fixed. Money put into a fixed deposit account with banks (commercial & small finance banks) is 100% safe (up to Rs. 5 lakh). DICGC, a fully owned subsidiary of RBI, guarantees to pay a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh (per bank) if the bank goes into liquidation. This deposit insurance is inclusive of the principal amount as well as the interest earned. Since the parameters (interest rates and tenure) of a fixed deposit are fixed, it becomes easy to predict returns. \nAll banks and most of the NBFCs offer customers with 5-year tax-saving FD. This scheme allows you to claim deductions u/s 80C of the IT Act, 1961 while filing the ITR. You can invest from Rs 100 to Rs 1.5 lakh in it. Tax saving fixed deposit comes with a lock-in period of 5 years. Investors can apply for a loan on their FD investments in times of need. Instead of opting for high-interest personal loans, if you have invested in a fixed deposit, you can avail Loan against FD. This loan can be taken for up to 90% of the FD amount (approximately). This means if you have an FD of Rs. 10 lakh, you can easily get a loan of up to Rs. 9 lakh (approximately). \nIf you have a fixed deposit, you can avail a secured credit card against it. However, the availability depends on the bank or NBFC involved. Its limit is set in line with your FD amount, thus making it secure. Fixed deposit is a highly affordable investment option as you can start investing from as little as Rs. 100. However, the majority of the top banks in India allow a minimum deposit of Rs. 1,000. Investors can choose to deposit their savings anywhere from 7 days to 10 days. Some banks (e.g. IDBI Bank) offer an extended period of up to 20 years. Fixed deposits, with a premature withdrawal facility, allow the depositor to close the FD before the date of maturity arrives. This comes as a relief in times of cash crunch. However, a certain amount may be required to be paid by the depositor as a penalty to the bank. This usually ranges between 0.5% and 1%. Some banks do offer premature withdrawal facilities with zero penalty charges. Fixed Deposits are one of the safest and most popular investment instrument among Senior Citizens. Individuals of or above the age of 60 years can enjoy a 0.25% – 0.65% extra interest rate over the normal FD rates.\nA recurring deposit (RD) :\nFixed tenure. You need to invest a fixed sum of money in it regularly—every month or once a quarter—to earn interest. Unlike FDs, where you need to make a lump sum deposit, the sum you need to invest here is smaller and more frequent. You can break a RD, but you face a penalty in the form of a lower interest rate for premature withdrawal. The maturity period of an RD is for a period of as less as 6 months or in multiples of 3 months with a highest term of 10 years. The interest rates presented under a Recurring Deposit is alike to the rates given under fixed deposits. If one is a senior citizen, then 0.5% extra rate of interest is granted. Advantages of Recurring Deposit are fixed monthly investment, fixed duration, and fixed rate of interest. Disadvantages of Recurring Deposit are you cannot withdraw the money anytime you wish, you cannot change the amount you like to invest monthly once decided, It has a comparatively lower rate of interest. Most banks that offer recurring deposits compound the interest on a quarterly basis. \nLike FD, investing in an RD also qualifies for taxation. For the money invested in a recurring deposit, tax is deducted at source, i.e. TDS. This tax is levied @ 10% p.a. if the deposit amounts to more than Rs. 40,000. It should be noted that it is the interest earned on RD that is taxable and not the full maturity amount. Investors with no taxable income must submit Form 15G to avoid TDS on both recurring deposits and fixed deposits. Both the fixed deposit and recurring deposit are risk-free investments. A fixed deposit will earn you more than a recurring deposit but some individuals also prefer a recurring deposit over a fixed deposit as they do not have enough money to invest at one go. Therefore, decide as per your affordability.",

PRADHAN_MANTRI_AWAS_YOJANA\n\nPMAY or Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is a government scheme launched in compliance with ‘Housing for All (HFA)’ mission through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). It provides a grant of Rs. 1 lakh per house by the Government of India for slum rehabilitation. Central assistance of Rs. 1.5 lakh per dwelling unit for affordable housing in partnership and beneficiary-led individual house construction/enhancement is offered. Interest subsidy of up to 6.5% on house loans is given. Interest subsidy for PMAY home loans is applicable to a maximum loan tenure of 20 years or the loan tenure availed by the borrower, whichever is lower. It encourages women to be homeowners or co-applicant. Compulsory ground floor accommodation for senior citizens and differently-abled is featured. Mandatory use of sustainable and eco-friendly materials for house construction. There is no limit on home loan amount or cost of the property.\nPMAY Beneficiary:\nA beneficiary family includes husband, wife, unmarried sons and/or daughters. An adult earning member of the family irrespective of his/her marital status can be treated as a separate household, provided he/she does not own a pucca house in his/her name in India. Adult earning member of the family with a pucca house of built-up area less than 21 sq. m. may be included for enhancement of existing dwelling units up to 30 sq. m. In case the enhancement is not possible due to lack of land availability/space or any other reason, he/she may get a house under PMAY (U) elsewhere.\nFamilies with annual income of up to Rs. 3 lakh are considered as Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Families with annual income between Rs. 3 lakh and Rs. 6 lakh  are considered as Low Income Group (LIG). Families within annual income between Rs. 6 lakh and Rs. 12 lakh are considered as Middle Income Group I. Families with annual income between Rs. 12 lakh and Rs. 18 lakh –are considered as Middle Income Group II.\nThe scheme has hence been divided into four verticals as given below:\nIn-situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) admits Central Assistance of Rs. 1 lakh per house. In Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) the beneficiaries of EWS and Low Income Group (LIG) are eligible for an interest subsidy at the rate of 6.5% for tenure of 20 years or during tenure of loan whichever is lower, available only for loan amounts upto Rs.6 lakh. The CLSS for MIG covers two income segments in the MIG viz. Rs.6,00,001 to Rs.12,00,000 (MIG-I) and Rs.12,00,001 to Rs.18,00,000 (MIG-II) per annum. In MIG-I, interest subsidy of 4% has been provided for loan amounts upto Rs.9 lakh while in MIG-II, interest subsidy of 3% has been provided for loan amounts upto Rs.12 lakh. In Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) provides Central Assistance of Rs. 1.5 Lakh per EWS house. In Beneficiary-led Individual House Construction/ Enhancement (BLC-N/ BLC-E) a Central Assistance upto Rs. 1.5 lakh per EWS house is provided .\nPMAY Application Process for New Applicants :\nTo apply online for PMAY, visit “http://pmaymis.gov.in/” – PM Awas Yojana official website. Select “Benefit under other 3 components” option under “Citizen Assessment” menu. Enter your 12-digit Aadhaar number and name as mentioned on your Aadhaar card. On successful verification of your Aadhaar number, you will be redirected to the PMAY application page. Enter the required details like your personal information, income details and bank account details. Tick on the “I am aware of…” checkbox. Enter Captcha and click the “Save” button. Once you click the “Save” option, a system generated application number will appear, which you can save for future. Download and print the filled-in PMAY application form. Submit the form at your nearest Common Service Centers (CSC) or financial institution/banks along with the supporting documents. A nominal fee of Rs. 25 + GST is to be paid at the time of form submission.\nInterest subsidy: CNAs disburse the interest subsidy to PLIs on the basis of the disbursements PLIs make to the beneficiaries. PLIs further disburse the interest subsidy borrowers’ home loan account upfront by deducting the subsidy amount from the principal loan amount. Resultantly, the borrower pays EMI on the remaining principal loan amount. This helps in reducing the total interest payable by the borrower. Net Present Value (NPV) of the interest subsidy is calculated at a discount rate of 9 %. If the house construction is not finished within 36 months from the date of release of the first disbursement, the subsidy will be recovered by the PLI and refunded to the CNA.",

          "context": "22. STARTUP_BUSINESS_LOAN\n\nSeveral leading financial institutions offer Startup loans for new businesses at attractive interest rates\nEligible applicant should have a self-drafted Business Plan. Startup to be formed must as a sole proprietorship, partnership firm, private or public limited company or a limited liability partnership (LLP)\nCredit score should be preferably 750 or above. Total turnover of the firm should not exceed Rs. 25 crore. The new entrepreneurs are granted tax relief for 3 years. Funds from venture capitals are quite expensive for a startup with investors of venture capital asking for as much as 5 to 10 times of the return on their investment. However, a bank loan does not require any equity dilution and the rate of return to the bank is fixed at a nominal interest rate\nThe minimum and maximum loan amount depend on the financial lender you choose and the requirement that you have. The minimum loan amount has no limit whereas the maximum loan amount can go up to Rs. 5 crores.Other than KYC documents, Last 12 months bank statement, Last 1 year ITR, Business Incorporation Certificate, Business Address Proof and PAN card should be provided.\nSchemes for Startups:\nStartup India Scheme is an initiative by the Government of India that offers instant business loans for startups for growth and expansion. Other key functions of Startup India include promotion of Startups, wealth creation, and employment generation. Stand-Up India Scheme offers funds to people who come under the SC/ST category and women entrepreneurs of the society. Stand-up India scheme was initiated by the Government of India to provide credit services, majorly to SC/ST category people. The primary purpose of this scheme is to help banks in offering loans between Rs.10 lakh and Rs.1 crore to at least one SC/ST applicant and one women entrepreneur, per bank branch in enabling them to start their own business. \npsbloansin59minutes.com: The Government of India has launched a web portal that approves business loan applications in just 59 minutes from the time of submission. The minimum loan amount offered under this scheme is Rs.10 lakh and the maximum is up to Rs.5 crores. The interest rate offered starts from 8.50% per annum.\nMudra Yojana under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) offers loans up to Rs. 10 lakh without asking borrowers for any collateral at affordable interest rates. The repayment tenure is up to 5 years and the processing fee is nil. There is no minimum loan amount criteria to borrow. \nUnder Credit Guarantee Funds Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises,first-time entrepreneurs and startup enterprises are majorly benefitted. The loan offered under the CGTMSE scheme is collateral-free.\nBusiness Installment Loan falls under the category of personal loans and similar to personal loans, it is an unsecured loan. Crowdfunding has become a popular way for small businesses to raise money, thanks to various websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which help borrowers to procure funds through online campaigns. Instead of paying back donors, one can choose to give them gifts, which is why this system is also called rewards crowdfunding. Grants from private foundations and government agencies are another way to raise startup funds for small businesses. Micro Loans from NPOs and NGOs primarily focus on minority or traditionally disadvantaged Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), as well as small businesses in communities that are struggling economically. There are some business loan schemes that provide loans without security, such as Mudra Yojana, Startup India, Standup India, and CGTMSE are loan schemes where one does not need to provide any asset as security before applying for a business loan.\n",

          "context": "28. CHEQUE\n\nA cheque is a replacement for hard cash in paper form, which can be exchanged between two parties, just as cash would have been exchanged, to settle the obligation of one party to another. It is also referred to as an electronic mode of transaction and can be easily deposited in a bank to withdraw funds in its place. A cheque is normally valid for a period of three months, before it lapses and is rendered useless. Cheque leaves printed with the word ‘bearer’ are called bearer cheques. The banks dispense the stated amount to the person holding the cheque. Bearer’s cheques are most vulnerable to frauds. Self cheques can be issued for withdrawing money from your own bank account or given to a third party as well. A cheque becomes a self cheque when you write your name on it. You can also write ‘self’ and give the cheque to a third party. However, writing self on cheques is not safe as anyone can claim the cheque and withdraw the funds. Pay Yourself Cheque are issued for buying bank drafts, pay orders and fixed deposits receipts. Pay yourself cheques are issued with a crossing on them as the drawer wants the bank to deduct the money from his/her bank account. \nPDC or Post Dated Cheque are given for encashing at a specific time. The bearer cannot encash the cheque before the stated time in any condition. These cheques are handy for making EMI payments. \nCrossed Cheque: A cheque crossed with two parallel lines on the top left corner is an account payee cheque that transfers the funds directly into the beneficiary’s account. The name of the beneficiary is written on the cheque and it cannot be negotiated for a cash withdrawal. These cheques are relatively safer than any other for making payments and transferring funds. Despite not having any marks, an order cheque is only payable to specific company or person. You have strike out the bearer part of the cheque to make it an order cheque. This is a safer form of transferring money to another person as no one except the person whose name is on the cheque can get the money. A mutilated cheque is torn at a corner. The payment on this cheque is only made after the confirmation of issuer.\nReasons for Cheque bounce:\nWhenever the authorised signatory to a cheque, makes a signature on a cheque before filing out the other mandatory details, the cheque is said to be made as a blank cheque. Often, this practice is adopted when a cheque is being made in lieu of a future uncertain event, the happening of which is contingent upon future events. However, the practice of using a blank cheque is more prevalent in the corporate environment. Cancel the words ‘or bearer’ and add ‘A/c payee’ on right hand corner within the two parallel crossed lines, indicating that it should be paid to the account of the person whose name is mentioned on the cheque. Insufficient Funds cause cheque bounce. If the date on the cheque is 3 months old from the present date, then the bank can bounce the cheque. Signature Mismatch is the most common reason for cheque bounce. Difference in Amount Mentioned in Numbers & Words also cause cheque bounce. Physcally Damaged Cheque, Overwriting on Cheque, when Drawer’s account is closed, Payment is stopped by the drawer, Garnishee order on account, Death or insanity of the drawer, The seal of the company is missing on the cheque issued by an organization, Suspicion of a forged cheque are other reasons for cheque bounce.\nIn case of a cheque bounce, If the payee decides to proceed legally, a chance is given to the drawer to pay the cheque amount immediately. For this, the payee is supposed to send a notice to the drawer within 30 days from the date the payee receives the “Cheque Return Memo” from the bank. The notice should state that the cheque amount must be paid to the payee within 15 days of receiving the notice. If the drawer still fails to pay money to the payee within 30 days of receiving the notice, the payee has full right to file a criminal report against the drawer as per the Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. \nCheque clearing systems:\nMagnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR): The cheque clearing systems have evolved from manual clearing system to MICR clearing systems in mid 1980s, which brought in automation, standardisation and efficiency in cheque clearing process. High Value Clearing (HVC) was introduced during the eighties for clearing cheques of value of Rupees one lakh and above. Following implementation of Core Banking Systems (CBS) in banks, Speed Clearing was launched in the year 2008, for local clearance of outstation cheques drawn on core-banking enabled branches of banks, which drastically reduced the turnaround time for clearing of outstation cheques. Cheque Truncation System or CTS enables use of the image of cheque for payment processing thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of cheques.",

          "context": "30. CREDIT_CARDS\n\nThe basic difference between a credit card and a debit card is that debit card is connected to your savings or current account whereas credit card is a type of loan taken from the bank. In case of a debit card, the amount is directly deducted from the connected savings/current account and there are no interest charges on its usage. However, in the case of a credit card, the amount is deducted from your credit limit. Most credit cards these days come with welcome benefits in the form of gift vouchers, discounts or bonus rewards points. Every time you make a purchase on your card, you receive reward points, air miles or direct cashback credited to your account. Almost all the cards come with this benefit of  Fuel Surcharge Waiver under which whenever you refill your vehicle, the surcharge will be waived off provided that you spend a certain amount. Some credit cards also offer a certain number of complimentary Airport lounge Access visits in a year at domestic airports and international airports. Credit cards also offer insurance and cover accidents up to a certain amount. A number of credit cards offer you the facility to get an add-on card also known as a supplementary card for your family members including your spouse, siblings, children and parents. An add-on card usually comes with similar benefits as the primary card. EMI Conversion is the most common benefit on a credit card. You can convert your big-ticket purchases to EMIs and pay over a period of a few months. Credit Cards helps in building a good credit score with Interest-free credit period of up to 45 days. Hassle-free transactions both online and offline is a feature of Credit cards. It comes handy in emergency financial situations. All transactions are secure as they need OTP & PIN authentication.\nDifferent Types of Credit Cards in India include Shopping Credit Cards, LifeStyle Credit Cards, Fuel Credit Cards, Rewards Credit Cards, Cashback Credit Cards, Travel Credit Cards\nDocuments Required:\nIdentity and Signature Proof such as Passport, PAN card, Driving License, Voter ID card, Aadhaar card, employee identity card in case of government employees is needed. Address Proof such as Bank statement, Rent Agreement, Voter ID card, Ration card, Passport, Driving License, telephone/ electricity/ water/ credit card bill or Property tax and Age Proof such as Voter ID card, Secondary School Certificate (class 10), birth certificate, Passport, Aadhaar Card, pension payment order or Receipt of LIC policy ar required. Income proof for Salaried Individual includes Latest 3 months' salary slips, Salary account bank statement for six months is needed. Income proof for Self-employed Businessmen/Professionals such as Latest IT Returns with computation of income and other certified financial documents along with business continuity proof is asked. If you have a pre-approved credit card offer from an issuer, you may not have to submit any document, especially if you already have an existing banking relationship with the issuer. You should note that cards that have an annual fee often provide more benefits than the zero annual fee cards.\nCash advance:\nYou can withdraw a part of your total credit limit as cash from an ATM. But such cash withdrawals carry additional charges and feature a higher interest rate than your card-based purchases. Hence, you should always avoid credit card cash withdrawals and consider taking a personal loan if you are in urgent need of cash. Credit limits are revised from time to time by the card issuer. \nCredit card interest rate: The interest rate is applied on any balance you owe on your card. Credit card interest rates are the highest among various debt instruments available to the customer. In most cases, interest rates start at 18% and may go up to 45% annually based on various factors such as the type of card, card issuer policies and various other factors. A secured credit card is issued against an asset say Fixed Deposit. It can be a good beginning for those who are not eligible to get a regular (unsecured) card. Premium credit cards offer extra benefits on lifestyle, travel, entertainment, dining, etc. and they also charge a substantial annual fee. International airport lounge access, concierge service, air accident insurance are some premium card features.\nCredit card balance transfer: Some credit cards offer the facility of transferring outstanding balances from other cards, consolidate the debt and pay back in EMIs. Banks also offer low introductory offers to encourage users to transfer balances from other cards. \nLost card liability cover: This is a zero liability benefit offered on most of the cards under which the card user will not be liable to pay any amount against the expenses occurred during the period between card loss and the user informing the bank.

          "context": "32. DEBIT_CARD\n\nDebit card is popularly known as easily accessible plastic cash, which offers electronic access to your savings account in any bank via ATM machines or card swipes. It has functions similar to those of credit cards, with the major difference being the fact that the amount is directly and immediately deducted from the user’s account instead of the money being paid by them at a later date. They have got names like bank cards, cash cards or check cards. The primary four issuers of debit cards around the world are American Express, Discover Card, Master Card and Visa. Apart from these there are some country specific debit cards popular in those countries along with a few more. To name a few UnionPay in China, RuPay in India and Maestro in the United Kingdom are some of the country specific debit card issuers. Using Debit card is a safe and secure option and it is a good alternative for cash, because it reduces the risk of fraud, theft and misuse. Debit cards are easy to carry, can be handled easily and can be conveniently utilized while travelling in comparison to cheque book or cash. With a huge number of ATM machines available all around, Debit card offers both the ease of instant cash and the provision of merchant transactions at Point of Sale (PoS) terminals. Using debit cards for purchase is also a rewarding experience because of its features like cash back offers, bonus points, free insurance coverage along with a range of redeeming options for the points accumulated. Debit cards also helps in keeping a track of your spends.  Regular email and SMS alerts with the details of transactions made through debit card helps in maintaining a record of your expenditures. Also one can make the most of their debit card by making use of a feature called customization of add on benefits. Using debit cards ensures that you spend responsibly, because the permissible limit of spending depends upon the money in your account. Recorded transaction makes the task of maintaining budget and money management much easier.\nDebit Cards and Credit Cards both look alike bearing a unique 16- digit card number, month and year of expiry and a 3 digit CVV (Card Verification Value) number on the back of the card. While they resemble each other look wise, features of debit card and credit card and their usage pattern varies drastically. Debit cards on the other hand are directly linked to the bank account of the user. Money for the debit card transactions is directly debited from your bank account which is linked to the debit card . These debits are however subject to maximum wi thdrawal or purchase limit per day decided by the bank. Credit cards on the other hand are like a line of credit offered by the banks and are linked to a credit card account that features a pre-defined limit. This card is issued by the banks on the basis of eligibility and credit history of the applicant. Once swiped, the bank pays the amount to vendor and the debits are added to the card holder’s account, which, in turn the cardholder needs to pay back to the bank within a stipulated time period. Credit card actually offers borrowed money which you must pay back in total at the end of your statement period. In case of debit card, it is not permissible for you to use money which is not in your account. \nDebit card frauds:\nAvoid using any online portal for making payments unless you are too sure about it. Avoid making use of card reading instruments that are damaged, mismatched or seems to have an ill-fitting at any publicly accessible kiosks placed outdoor. Such kiosks may have hidden skimmers which may leak your debit card credentials to unauthorized sources. Be precautious while handing over your cards to someone, especially if it leaves your sight. For example while giving your card to a waiter/waitress at a restaurant, keep a track of the time they take to get back to you. In most cases it is suggested to make frequent use of a debit card tied into a separate account which has limited amount of money meant exclusively for debit transactions.\nRuPay Debit Cards: \nRuPay cards have emerged as a strong contender to VISA and MasterCard in India. The Board for Payment and Settlement Systems in India was established in 2005 after the RBI realized the need to bring together, all retail payment systems under one channel and this gradually led to the formation of NPCI. The National Payment Corporation of India promoted by the Reserve Bank of India introduced RuPay in 2012. RuPay cards have since then seen a colossal growth and is becoming a favorite among the Indians. The transaction cost is very less when compared to the other debit card variants in the market - Visa and MasterCard because the whole transaction process takes place within India. RuPay cards are easily available to people with limited or no banking accessibility and RuPay cards are available in rural areas also. NPCI is also planning to offer EMV cards, contactless credit and debit cards under the RuPay label. With IRCTC RuPay prepaid debit cards, customers can book train tickets without any hassles. High transaction and withdrawal limit that comes with RuPay debit cards will offer immense flexibility to the customers.",

          "context": "34. NET_BANKING_AND_MOBILE_BANKING\n\nNet banking, also known as internet banking, is a digital method to conduct banking transactions by the means of the internet. It is an electronic system. A bank customer can access net banking from any internet-enabled device such as a laptop, computer desktop or mobile phone. They do not necessarily need to visit the bank to transfer money from one account to another, to check their transactions statement or to address banking transactions-related queries.  A net banking account enables customers to do all their new account openings digitally. This is possible with the help of the pre-submitted know-your-customer (KYC) details that consumers submit to their banks at the time of opening of the net banking account. Net banking Ensures Security of the Bank Account. For netbanking, all information on your bank’s details, transactions and requests is exchanged electronically without any human intervention. This reduces the possibility of any kind of slip-ups on behalf of customers, in terms of revealing their private banking information to a third party, and avoids misuse of any information. Netbanking Aids Financial Empowerment. When a customer uses netbanking, it enables them to learn about the nitty-gritties associated with their bank accounts and the processes behind the transactions. \nTo open a netbanking account:\nYour first step to begin a netbanking account is to approach your bank to enable an online banking facility for your existing bank account. Unless you request your bank to start your banking services online, you can’t begin using these services. Then Collect Your User ID and Password. This User ID is different from your bank account number, which serves as the primary identity of your bank account. You have to request your bank to generate a User ID and password. In the case of a new account, documents with a User ID and password are handed over at the time of opening the account. It is also advisable to change your User ID after you authenticate your first log-in to ensure you have a fresh set of User ID and password. You can now begin your transactions online. \nUses of a Netbanking Account:\nYou can transfer funds within your own internal bank accounts, from one bank account to another, from your own account in one bank to another account in another bank or from your own bank account to someone else’s bank account.  You can use the provision of “Standing Instruction” to repeat transfers on a periodic basis. Using Netbanking to keep track of debits and credits into your bank account. By a simple click, you can find out transactions done for specific periods of time and request for account statements to be delivered in your email inbox whenever needed. Using Netbanking to pay phone bills, electricity bills, water utilities bills and other bills that have an online network. Loans can be easily applied for online using netbanking. It enables you to be KYC-compliant such that the time taken by loan companies to verify you and your credit score to grant a loan gets much shorter and less cumbersome for both stakeholders. With netbanking, customers can opt for “Standing Instructions” for specific future dates without worrying about missing a date or incurring a fine to pay Insurance premiums. Using Netbanking to Pay EMIs/ electronic monthly instalments. Using Netbanking to Apply for a New Debit Card and Cheque Books. Mobile banking is a facility that enables customers to initiate and/or perform banking tasks on their mobile phones. Customers can use mobile banking to view their account balance, make instant fund transfers and pay bills, etc. There are various types of mobile banking, viz. via SMS, USSD and mobile apps.

Also, there may be times when you have some grievances and due to lack of time, are not able to address. For such extra services, you can always resort to your bank’s mobile banking and find solutions to your complaints or queries. \nAlong with mobile apps, most banks offer mobile banking services over SMS. This service is useful for those who do not have smartphones and/or internet connection. Customers need to register their mobile number with their bank in order to avail SMS banking. \nUSSD or Unstructured Supplementary Service Data is a type of communication via which one can exercise basic banking services.

          "context": "31. PAN\n\nPAN, which stands for Permanent Account Number, is used to open a bank account, to file your tax return, invest in financial instruments or conduct any finance-related activity. A PAN card is a card issued under the Income Tax Act, 1961 and it contains a unique 10-digit alphanumeric code. This code is computer-generated and is unique to the holder of the card.The PAN Card is not only issued to individuals. Companies and partnership firms can also avail a PAN Card and it becomes mandatory for such entities to have a PAN number when they are filing their income tax returns. Even in case of individuals, minors, students and Non-Resident Indians can also apply PAN Card online. People can apply for a PAN card by filling Form 49A or Form 49AA. In case of Indian individuals/entities, form 49A is filled where as in case of foreigners, PAN card form 49AA is to be filled. Although PAN card for minors and students can also apply by filling PAN card form 49A. In case you have lost your PAN card, you can apply for a duplicate PAN card online as well as offline. TIN-NSDL and UTIITSL allow people to fill the form and make the payment online for a duplicate copy of your PAN card. You will receive your PAN card in next 45 days.\nTypes of PAN Card:\nPAN Card for Individuals, for Non-Resident Individuals or Persons of Indian Origin, and for foreign entities paying tax in India. Firms or corporates which are registered outside India but pay tax in India by virtue of their business operations conducted in India can also avail a PAN Card. They would have to fill and submit Form 49AA as part of the PAN card application process. Firms and corporate entities registered as well as working in India can also apply for a PAN Card for their financial and tax-related transactions.\nAdvantages of PAN Card:\nIndividuals and entities (companies, partnership firms, HUFs, etc.) are required to quote their PAN numbers whenever they file a tax return. This is a mandatory requirement. If there is no PAN card, individuals and entities would be required to pay a flat tax of 30% on their earning irrespective of the income-tax bracket they might fall in. So, for the purpose of taxation, a PAN number is required and one can check PAN card status by PAN number. Companies, partnership firms, Hindu Undivided Families or other entities who seek registration of their businesses cannot do so if they do not have a PAN number to quote in the registration details. A host of financial transactions can be done only if the PAN card no. of the individual/entity is available. Some common transactions facilitated by the PAN card include sale or purchase of any immovable property the value of which is Rs.5 lakhs and above, sale or purchase of any vehicle except a two-wheeler, depositing any amount higher than Rs.50,000 in a bank, buying bonds valued at Rs.50,000 or above, remitting funds outside India, travel expenses made for travelling overseas if such expenses are in excess of Rs.25,000, buying mutual fund schemes, buying insurance policies or shares valued at Rs.50,000 and above, etc. In many instances when utilities like a post-paid mobile phone connection, LPG connection, electricity connection, internet connection, etc. are required, a PAN card comes in handy. However, it is always recommended that you use alternate ID proof such as DL, Voter ID card, etc.  if possible. Nowadays the bank’s Know Your Customer (KYC) norms have become quite stringent and the PAN card is a primary requirement, banks carry out their individual number verification when opening a bank account.\nAll applicants residing in India have to pay a fee of Rs 107 and those residing outside India have to pay a fee of Rs 1017 when submitting PAN form. According to the Section 160 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a representative assessee can represent a minor, mentally challenged and wards of court. In such cases details of the minor, lunatic, idiot, mentally retarded, wards of court, etc. All PAN cards that are not linked with Aadhaar will be deactivated after 31st March 2022. Linking PAN with Aadhaar will help in tackling the problem of multiple PAN cards issued in the same name. Your income tax return form would not be processed if your PAN is not linked with Aadhaar.",

          "context": "33. DIGITAL_PAYMENTS\n\nAfter the launch of Cashless India, we currently have ten methods of digital payment available in India. Banking Cards are preferred because of multiple reasons, including, but not limited to, convenience, portability, safety, and security. This is the only mode of digital payment that is popular in online transactions and physical transactions alike. Nowadays, many apps are being launched with the sole purpose of managing card transactions like Cred, Square, etc. Unstructured Supplementary Service Data(USSD) was launched for those sections of India’s population which don’t have access to proper banking and internet facilities. Under USSD, mobile banking transactions are possible without an internet connection by simply dialing *99# on any essential feature phone. Around 51 leading banks offer USSD service in 12 different languages, including Hindi & English. Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) is a bank-led model for digital payments that was initiated to leverage the presence and reach of Aadhar. AEPS doesn’t require any physical activity like visiting a branch, using debit or credit cards or making a signature on a document. This bank-led model allows digital payments at PoS (Point of Sale / Micro ATM) via a Business Correspondent(also known as Bank Mitra) using Aadhaar authentication. The AePS fees for Cash withdrawal at BC Points are around Rs.15.\nUPI is a payment system that culminates numerous bank accounts into a single application, allowing the transfer of money easily between any two parties. The benefit of using UPI is that it allows you to pay directly from your bank account, without the need to type in the card or bank details. \nMobile Wallets, as the name suggests, are a type of wallet in which you can carry cash but in a digital format. Often customers link their bank accounts or banking cards to the wallet to facilitate secure digital transactions. Another way to use wallets is to add money to the Mobile Wallet and use the said balance to transfer money. Nowadays, many banks have launched their wallets. Additionally, notable private companies have also established their presence in the Mobile Wallet space. Some popularly used ones include Paytm, Freecharge, Mobikwik, mRupee, Vodafone M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Jio Money, SBI Buddy, Vodafone M-Pesa, Axis Bank Lime, ICICI Pockets, etc. A bank prepaid card is a pre-loaded debit card issued by a bank, usually single-use or reloadable for multiple uses. It is different from a standard debit card because the latter is always linked with your bank account and can be used numerous times. PoS(Point of Sale) is known as the location or segment where a sale happens. For a long time, PoS terminals were considered to be the checkout counters in malls and stores where the payment was made. First is the contactless reader of a PoS machine, which can debit any amount up to Rs. 2000 by auto-authenticating it, without the need of a Card PIN. Internet Banking, also known as e-banking or online banking, allows the customers of a particular bank to make transactions and conduct other financial activities via the bank’s website. NEFT, RTGS, or IMPS are some of the top ways to make transactions via internet banking. Mobile banking refers to the act of conducting transactions and other banking activities via mobile devices, typically through the bank’s mobile app. Digital payment methods, such as IMPS, NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, investments, bank statements, bill payments, etc., are available on a single platform in mobile banking apps. Micro ATM is a device for Business Correspondents (BC) to deliver essential banking services to customers. These Correspondents, who could even be a local store owner, will serve as a  ‘micro ATM’ to conduct instant transactions. They will use a device that will let you transfer money via your Aadhaar linked bank account by merely authenticating your fingerprint. The only requirement for Micro ATMs is that you should link your bank account to Aadhaar.",

          "context": "38. MONEY_MARKET_FUNCTIONS\n\nMoney Market funds are steady return products, with little risk of default. These funds tend to offer the benefits of stability and liquidity to their investors. Money market funds generate income from interest payments and capital gains. Also, the interest rates and the market price of these funds go hand in hand. When the interest rate rises, the market price of these funds increases, allowing the investor to earn through higher interest income. When the interest rate falls, the market price of money market funds decreases. It must be noted that higher the interest rate, higher will be the income generated by the investor. This can, therefore, be considered as the ideal time for investing in money market funds. Money market funds deal with bulk orders and require investors to pool in a huge amount of money; hence, they are suitable for large corporates and retail investors rather than individual investors\nIf you are an investor with a medium to long investment horizon, you may consider investing in dynamic bond funds or balanced funds instead of money market funds which may offer better returns. Money market funds are suitable only for investors with a short term investment horizon i.e. 3 months to 1 year. Liquid Funds have a maturity period of 91 days, whereas Money Market Funds mature in a time period of one year. Liquid funds are a type of mutual funds that invest in money market securities with a comparatively shorter investment duration. These funds are known to allow their investors to withdraw their funds on a very short notice. Money market funds are highly liquid assets. Money market funds are fixed income investment instruments that offer a fixed rate of interest decided by the RBI. Additionally, these instruments also pay out their earnings in the form of dividends, which do not qualify for a tax break.The interest rate on money market funds is decided by the RBI and is generally calculated on an everyday basis. This interest amount is paid directly into the accounts of the investors at the end of each month.\nFunctions of Money market:\nIt provides trade financing. Modern day money markets play a vital role in ensuring that there is adequate capital available to institutions engaged in domestic as well as international trade. Internationally, short term funding for ventures may be available to traders through ‘bills of exchange’ apart from other routes. These are instruments that are discounted by the bill market.It Ensures Industrial Financing. \nMany industries and industrial houses issue bonds on the bond market or shares on the stock market in order to receive long term financing of their operations. There are two ways in which money markets help with industrial financing- providing short term funding and producing an impact on capital markets. Short term funding from money markets can help industries finance their day to day operations and meet working capital requirements. The long term capital is obtained by industries through the issue of bonds or shares on applicable capital markets. High Liquidity Investment Solution:\nThe money market offers a lucrative, low risk route to institutions such as commercial banks in using their excess funds to earn additional income. It ensures self sufficiency of banks. Commercial banks operating in developed money markets have ample opportunities to invest and generate further income such that their self sufficiency improves in the long term. In case of dire cash crunch, banks can borrow funds from the RBI. It Maintains Money Supply for Central Banks. Central Banks are responsible for maintaining and controlling both the money market and capital market. As these markets operate using short term interest rates, they serve as an indicator of the country’s overall economic health. ",

          "context": "37. MONEY_MARKET\n\nMoney market funds are financial instruments having a short maturity period of up to 1 year. These funds are debt securities offering a fixed rate of interest and hence, are used as tools for raising capital by the issuer. However, money market funds are generally unsecured and involve a theoretically high risk of non-repayment. While there is also no collateral backing up of the security in these funds, they tend to offer a high credit rating ensuring that issuers don’t default, which makes them a go-to avenue for investors looking for options to park their money for short term and earn fixed returns on the same. Money market instruments, also known as long term borrowing instruments are grouped as ‘papers’ in contrast to ‘bonds’ and ‘shares’ and are traded on capital markets. One of the core drivers of money markets is inter-bank lending. Inter-bank lending refers to banks lending to and borrowing from other banks using money market instruments such as repurchase agreements and commercial papers. In India, the RBI regulates the REPO rate which is a benchmark rate to be used by domestic banks for the purpose of lending and borrowing from one another.\nFeatures of Money Market Funds:\nThe maturity period of one year offered by these funds makes them highly liquid. Additionally, these funds tend to generate fixed income for the investors in such a short period; owing to which they are taken for close substitutes of money. Moreover, it is easy to trade money market instruments across currencies, maturities, debt structure as well as credit risk, which makes it ideal for institutions seeking to borrow or invest for the short term. These financial instruments are considered one of the most secure investment avenues available in the market. Since issuers of money market instruments have a high credit rating and the returns are fixed beforehand, the risk of losing the invested capital is minuscule. Since money market instruments are offered at a discount to the face value, the amount that the investor gets on maturity is decided in advance. Money markets across the world essentially operate over the counter, which implies that the trading of these funds cannot be made online. Hence, investments in the money market are made physically by authorized representatives or in person. Later, a physical certificate is issued to the buyer of the money market instrument. Money markets are designed to provide and accept bulk orders. Thus, retail investors who have enough capital can directly participate in money markets, while individual investors must invest in debt mutual funds that invest in money markets in order to benefit from this market. Unlike capital markets which usually trade in one single type of instrument, money markets trade is multiple instruments. These instruments differ in terms of maturity periods, debt structure, credit risk, currency, among others. Money market instruments are therefore considered ideal for diversification through exposure.Since money markets deal with only bulk orders, they are not open to individual investors. As a result of which, multiple institutional investors such as financial institutions and dealers looking to borrow or lend money for a short term participate in the trading of these instruments.\nThe Indian money market is controlled and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. One of the most crucial functions of the money market is to maintain liquidity in the economy. Some of the money market instruments are an important part of the monetary policy framework. RBI uses these short-term securities to get liquidity in the market within the required range. Money markets allow investors to withdraw their funds on very short notice. Hence, it is advised that institutions borrow funds from the market instead of borrowing from banks, as the process is hassle-free and the interest rate is also lower than that of commercial loans. Sometimes, commercial banks also use these money market instruments to maintain the minimum cash reserve ratio as per the RBI guidelines. Money Market makes it easier for investors to dispose of their surplus funds while retaining their liquid nature and offering significant profits on the same. It facilitates investors’ (such as banks, non-financial corporations, state and local government) savings into investment channels. The money market enables financial mobility to investors by allowing easy transfer of funds from one sector to another, thereby ensuring transparency in the system. High financial mobility is important for the overall growth of the economy as it promotes industrial and commercial development. A developed money market helps RBI in efficiently implementing monetary policies. Transactions in the money market affect short term interest rate which gives an overview of the current monetary and banking state of the country. This further helps RBI in formulating the future monetary policy, deciding long term interest rates, and creating suitable banking policy.\n",

          "context": "39. MONEY_MARKET_INSTRUMENTS\n\nTreasury Bills:\nTreasury bills or T-bills are issued by the Reserve Bank of India on behalf of the Central Government for raising money. T-bills do not pay any interest but are available at a discount to the face value at the time of issue. At maturity, the investor gets the face value amount. This difference between the initial value and face value is the return earned by the investor. Treasury Bills are by far the oldest of money market instruments and are considered to be the safest short term fixed income investments as they are backed by the Government of India. Since T-bills are issued by the government, they offer guaranteed returns and are known to be zero default risk investments. Additionally, T-bills have a short maturity period of up to 1 year. T-Bills are commonly classified on the basis of their maturity period and their type. The maturity-based classification of treasury bills names them as 10-day TBs, 91-day TBs, 182-day TBs, and 364-day TBs. The other classification includes auction bills and tap bills. Auction bills follow a multiple price system in order to ensure fair pricing. These bills are also termed as regular bills as they are available for investment by banks and other participating institutions\nCommercial Papers:\nLarge companies and businesses issue promissory notes to raise capital from investors in order to meet their short term business needs. These promissory notes are known as Commercial Papers (CPs)\nThe firms issuing commercial papers have a high credit rating, owing to which they are unsecured, with the company’s credibility acting as security for the financial instrument\nCorporates, primary dealers (PDs) and All-India Financial Institutions (FIs) can issue CPs. CPs have a fixed maturity period ranging from 7 days to 270 days. However, investors can trade this instrument in the secondary market, wherever they offer relatively higher returns compared to that from treasury bills\nCertificate of Deposit (CD):\nCertificates of deposit are financial assets issued by banks and financial institutions, offering a fixed interest rate on the invested amount, similar to a fixed deposit\nThe primary difference between a CD and a Fixed Deposit is that of the principal amount. A certificate of deposit is issued only for large sums of money (1 lakh or in multiples of 1 lakh thereafter). The maturity period of Certificates of Deposits ranges from 7 days to 1 year if issued by banks. However, other financial institutions also issue a CD with a maturity period of 1 year to 3 years\nRepurchase Agreements or Ready Forward Contract (Repo):\nAlso known as repos or buybacks, a Repurchase Agreement is a formal agreement between two parties, where one party sells a security to another, with the promise of buying it back at a later date. It is also called a Sell-Buy transaction. The seller buys the security at a predetermined time and amount which also includes the interest rate at which the buyer agreed to buy the security. The interest rate charged by the buyer for agreeing to buy the security is called Repo rate. \nBanker’s Acceptance:\nThis is a financial instrument produced by an individual or a corporation in the name of the bank, wherein the issuer must pay a specified amount to the instrument holder on a predetermined date, between 30 and 180 days, starting from the date of issue of the instrument. Banker’s Acceptance is issued at a discounted price, and the actual price is paid to the holder at maturity. The difference between the two is the profit made by the investor. Banker’s acceptance is a secure financial instrument as the payment is guaranteed by a commercial bank\nCall Money:\nCall money essentially represents a short term loan for the purpose of making stock exchange transactions with maturities ranging from 1 day to 14 days and is repayable on demand. The call money market participants are allowed to lend and borrow using the call money instruments such as STCI (Securities Trading Corporation of India), DFHI (Discount and Finance House of India), co-operative banks and Indian and foreign commercial banks. Call money loans feature a fixed interest rate, termed as call rate, which being closely related to changes in demand and supply, is quite volatile. Due to this high level of volatility, the call money market is considered to be the most sensitive section of India’s money market\nInterest Rate Swaps:\nInterest rate swap is referred to a financial transaction in which two parties sign a deal wherein one pays a fixed rate of interest, and the other pays a floating rate of interest. The fixed rate of interest payable is calculated using a notional principal amount, while the floating rate of interest is paid on the actual principal lent out/borrowed with the rate varying on the basis of market conditions. In India, interest rate swaps are mainly used by commercial banks. However, these are separate products that are not directly linked to the bank’s assets such as money lent to customers in the form of loans.\nThis money market instrument protects the borrower from interest rates changes even though the borrower is on the hook for any variable markup payments not covered by the interest rate swap agreement.\n",

          "context": "40. INVESTMENTS_AND_SAVINGS\n\nThere are 2 buckets that investment products fall into and they are financial and non-financial assets. Financial assets can be divided into market-linked products (such as stocks and mutual fund) and fixed income products (like Public Provident Fund, bank fixed deposits). Non-financial assets - many Indians invest via this mode - are the likes of physical gold and real estate.\nAny investment is the act of buying or creating assets with an expectation that the same would yield interest earnings or dividend or capital appreciation or any other return that is profitable as compared to the money put in initially. While saving may be understood as a passive way of accumulating wealth, investment can be seen as a more aggressive way of securing returns. Mostly, under savings, customers avail a savings account and stash away cash in it. The two types of Investments are Traditional and Alternative Investments.\nTraditional Investments:\nInvesting in well-known financial products falls into the category of traditional investments. A Bond can be understood as an IOU which is issued by an issuer (borrower) and to a lender. Generally, bonds are instruments used by public and private sector enterprises to raise huge sums of money which any bank is incapable of lending. These bonds are then issued in the public market by the borrowing entity and are bought by lenders for specific amounts of money. Bonds fall under the category of fixed income securities since the interest on these can be exactly calculated for the time for which the bond is held.  Stocks or equity are shares that are issued by companies and are bought by the general public. This offers an avenue to companies to raise funds. Stocks entitle a customer ownership of a company. Shares, stocks and equity all imply the same thing. to balance out the high return associated with stocks, the risk associated with these products is also quite high.\nSome of the most common small savings tools are Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme, EPF (Employees Provident Fund), NPS (National Pension Scheme, Kisan Vikas Patra, Personal Provident Fund (PPF) etc. Almost all small savings schemes are initiated and facilitated by the government. Mutual funds are financial instruments that are professionally managed and that invest money on behalf of any investor, in different securities. Some of the most popular mutual fund types are balanced funds, stock funds, open-ended funds etc. So, an equity fund invests purely is equity and is a high risk high return product while a debt fund invests purely in debt and money market instruments and is hence a low risk low return financial product.\nIn fixed deposits a fixed amount of money is kept aside with a financial institution for a fixed number of days or months or years. Customers who do not have a large chunk of money to fix in a single go can opt for a recurring deposit wherein money is usually deposited monthly for a specific deposit tenure. Real estat is a traditional investment. Property rates are soaring with every passing day which has made real estate a hot investment avenue for investors. Buying, selling and leasing of property offers substantial returns to investors. Appreciation of property makes real estate a good investment tool. \nAlternative Investments:\nAlternative Investments are those that are not regular investments like stocks, bonds etc and complex in nature. It has relatively low liquidity and well as very high minimum investment limits.\nHedge Funds can be understood as a professionally managed private investment company or partnership structure. Techniques to manage the fund can be those that are not commonly allowed for SEC regulated companies. Hedge funds invest in both financial derivatives and/or publicly traded securities. These are popular as an alternative investment tool owing to their high leverage and high returns. However, they are characterized by high fees as well as low liquidity. Private equity is trading in shares of an operating company that is not publicly listed and whose shares are not available on the stock market. Institutional investors employ various strategies to indulge in private equity trading. The idea behind Venture Capital is this investment strategy is to invest substantial capital in a budding company in return for stocks of the same. This is done with companies who are either in their initiation phase or in their growth phase. Managed Futures involves managers using futures also as part of their investment portfolio. In general, a managed futures account will have sufficient exposure to different markets like energy, agriculture, commodities, currency etc. Structured products are alternative investment tools that generally combine two or more financial instruments to make a packaged investment strategy in a single product. Most often, derivatives are combined with securities or with other derivatives. Structured products have a fixed maturity date like bonds. Collectible items or Collecting artifacts that have substantial value and those that have historical and artistic significance is one of the most difficult types of alternative investments. This requires knowledge of the article that you are purchasing. Mostly, collectibles like stamps, jewelry, boats, planes, art works etc. tend to appreciate in value and are considered good and profitable assets to own. The value of artifacts is generally expected to appreciate and keep pace with inflation and hence collectibles make a good form of alternative investment.",

The invested amount doubles every 124  months (10 years and 4 months). Investment is available in denominations of Rs.1,000, Rs. 5,000, Rs.10,000 and Rs. 50,000. The investment comes with a minimum limit of Rs.1,000 and with no maximum limit. Certificates are easily transferable and can be endorsed to a third person. The certificate is comparatively liquid in nature as it offers an encashment facility after 2.5 years of investment. There is no tax deduction on the principal amount invested and interest on the KVP is also taxable. The scheme is not tax-efficient. \nSenior Citizen’s Savings Scheme:\nThe minimum age of entry is 60 years for SCSS. Someone who has taken voluntary retirement after 55 years of age can also open this account within a month of receiving the retirement benefits. Maximum limit of investment allowed per individual (combined balances in all accounts) is Rs. 15 lakhs. The investment amount can be in multiples of Rs.1000. Current rate of interest offered is  7.4 % per annum payable on the first working day of each quarter. The deposit has a maturity period of 5 years. The scheme also allows premature withdrawals of deposits after a year with a penalty of 1.5%. The penalty of 1 % is levied after 2 years of deposit. Account can be extended for three more years after the scheme matures. Investments are eligible for tax deduction under Section 80C of The Income Tax Act. However, the tax will be deducted at source if the amount of interest exceeds Rs.10,000 in a year.\nNational Savings Certificate (NSC):\nThe NSC has a maturity period of 5 years. The NSC rate of interest is 6.8% per annum compounded half-yearly but payable at maturity. That means, your investment of Rs. 100,000 will yield you Rs. 1,38,949 after 5 years. There is no maximum limit on investment with a minimum amount of investment of Rs.100. Investments can be done in denominations of Rs.100, Rs. 500, Rs. 1,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs.10,000. The NSC Certificate can be purchased in single holding or on behalf of a minor. Investment in NSC is tax deductible under Section 80C of The Income Tax Act. Interest on NSC is deemed to also be reinvested under Section 80 C and hence tax deductible, except interest in the final year of the NSC. NSC certificates can be pledged as security for availing bank loans.\nCertificates are transferable. Transfer from one person to another person is allowed only once during the investment tenure. NSC is a risk-free and tax efficient saving scheme for long-term and traditional investors with no risk appetite.\nSukanya Samriddhi Scheme:\nSukanya Samriddhi is a scheme introduced for the benefit of the girl child. It currently offers an attractive interest rate of 7.6% per annum compounded annually. The minimum amount of investment is Rs.1000 and maximum of Rs.1,50,000 in a financial year. You have to invest at least the minimum amount every year for 15 years from the date of account opening. Thereafter the account will continue to earn interest till maturity. Investment in the Sukanya Samridhhi Account is tax deductible under Section 80 C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. The interest on the Sukanya Samriddhi Account is also tax free and the maturity amount is tax free. Investment will mature after the completion of 21 years from the date of opening the account or upon marriage of the girl child after attaining the age of 18. The account will also have to be closed if the girl child becomes an NRI or loses her Indian citizenship. Sukanya Samriddhi account can be opened only in the name of girl child by her parents or legal guardians. Girl’s age should be 10 years or less on the date of opening the account. Multiple accounts cannot be opened in the name of one girl child. A parent/guardian can open maximum of two accounts in the name of two different girl children. There will be a penalty of Rs.50 if minimum amount is not deposited in a financial year.\nPremature closure can only be done by a girl child on attaining the age of majority that is 18 years for the purpose of marriage or higher education. Girl can also avail partial withdrawal facility (not more than 50% of the balance) after attaining the age of 18 years. Parents/guardian can avail a tax benefit for the invested amount under Section 80C of The Income Tax Act. Maturity proceeds are paid to the girl child and are completely tax free in her hands. This scheme has gained lot of popularity especially in rural India. It’s a good means to provide financial security to the next generation of women in the country.",

          "context": "44. NPS\n\nThe NPS invests the contributions of its subscribers into various market-linked instruments such as equities and debts and the final pension amount depends on the performance of these investments. It has an applicable interest rate of 12% to 14% on contributions made. Any Indian citizen in the age group of 18-60 can open an NPS account. NPS is administered and regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory Authority of India (PFRDA). The NPS matures at the age of 60 but can be extended until the age of 70. The scheme does not offer a fixed interest rate and is available between 12% to 14%. This Rate of interest is apparently higher than the ROI offered by many other saving schemes. Money contributed to the NPS account can be invested in up to 4 asset classes – equities, corporate bonds, government bonds and alternative assets through various pension funds. Out of the 4 asset classes the allocation to equities cannot be more than 75% of the corpus and that too is valid only up to 50 years of age. From 51 years onwards the allocation to equity starts tapering off as per a defined matrix. Similarly, your contribution towards Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) cannot be more than 5% of your corpus. NPS does not have a fixed interest rate but the returns are market-linked. \nTypes of NPS Accounts:\nTier I Account: This account carries a tax deduction under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum and an additional amount up to Rs 50,000 per annum under Section 80CCD (1B). This is a non-withdrawable permanent retirement account. On maturity i.e at the age of 60, 60% of the corpus which is tax-free can be withdrawn. Another 40% must mandatorily be used to buy an annuity. The balance 20% can either be used to buy an annuity or can be withdrawn after paying tax. In NPS Tier 1, the minimum initial contribution is Rs 500. However, the minimum annual contribution to your NPS Tier I account is Rs 1,000. There is no maximum annual contribution. The minimum amount per contribution is Rs 500.\nTier II Account: This is a voluntary retirement-cum-savings account that can be opened only if you have a Tier I account. Subscribers are free to invest or withdraw their funds anytime according to their convenience. In NPS Tier 2, the minimum initial contribution is Rs 1,000. There is no minimum or maximum annual contribution. The minimum amount per contribution is Rs 250.\nNPS Charges:\nPension Fund Manager fees are capped at 0.01% compared to 2-2.5% for mutual funds. NPS investments are market-linked hence their returns cannot be predicted in advance. Thus the expected rate of return (expressed as a percentage value) is used to calculate the future corpus value of your NPS contributions. Higher the value in this field, higher is the final corpus size. Annuity Purchase percentage figure indicates the portion of your NPS future corpus that will be used to purchase annuities that determine your monthly pension after retirement. Under existing rules, a minimum 40% of NPS corpus is to be mandatorily used for the purchase of annuities. Higher the portion of NPS future corpus used for annuity purchase, greater will be the monthly pension that you will get.\nNational Pension Schemes Benefits:\nNPS is a beneficial scheme to invest in as the investments are made into equities which can be risky but also offer higher returns as compared to other tax-saving investment schemes like Public Provident Fund. So far, the scheme has delivered 8% to 10% annualized returns. The tax benefits available under NPS are the most important reason why one should consider investing in this scheme. As a long-term investment scheme, it allows a tax deduction of a maximum Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2). Moreover, the subscribers are eligible to get an additional benefit of Rs.50,000 which can be claimed by the investor as tax benefit under Section 80CCD(1B). Since it is a pension scheme, you must keep yourself invested until the age of 60 years. However, NPS allows the subscribers to make premature partial withdrawals under special cases. A maximum of 25% of the accumulated amount can be partially withdrawn after completion of at least 5 years of continuous contributions in the fund. The same can be processed to furnish Child’s marriage, Higher education, buying house or medical emergencies. You can invest in both NPS and APY and other retirement vehicles like EPF or PPF. There is no bar to this. In the event of the death of the subscriber, the nominee will receive the entire accumulated pension wealth. If the subscriber has not declared a nominee then it will go to the legal heir of the subscriber. In both the cases, there would not be any requirement for purchasing an annuity or a monthly pension plan.\n",

          "context": "46. MUTUAL_FUNDS_TYPES\n\nMutual funds in India are broadly classified into equity funds, debt funds, money market funds and balanced mutual funds, depending on their asset allocation and equity exposure. \nEquity funds:\nAs the name suggests, invest mostly in equity shares of companies across all market capitalisations. A mutual fund is categorised under equity fund if it invests at least 65% of its portfolio in equity instruments. Equity funds have the potential to offer the highest returns among all classes of mutual funds. The returns provided by equity funds depend on the market movements, which are influenced by several geopolitical and economic factors. The equity funds are further classified into small cap, mid cap, large cap, multi cap funds.Small-cap funds are those equity funds that predominantly invest in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with small market capitalisation. SEBI defines small-cap companies as those that are ranked after 251 in market capitalisation. Mid-cap funds are those equity funds that invest primarily in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with medium market capitalisation. SEBI defines mid-cap companies as those that are ranked between 101 and 250 in market capitalisation. Large-cap funds are those equity funds that invest mostly in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with large market capitalisation. SEBI defines large-cap companies as those that are ranked between 1 and 100 in market capitalisation. Multi-Cap Funds invest substantially in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies across all market capitalisations. Sectoral funds invest principally in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies in a particular sector like FMCG and IT. Thematic funds invest in equities of companies that operate with a similar theme like travel. Index Funds are a type of equity funds having the intention of tracking and emulating the performance of a popular stock market index such as the S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty50. The asset allocation of an index fund would be the same as that of its underlying index. \nDebt Mutual Funds:\nDebt mutual funds invest mostly in debt, money market and other fixed-income instruments such as treasury bills, government bonds, certificates of deposit, and other high-rated securities. A mutual fund is considered a debt fund if it invests a minimum of 65% of its portfolio in debt securities. The debt funds are further classified as dynamic funds, Income funds, Liquid funds, short term funds, Gilt funds. Dynamic Bond Funds are those debt funds whose portfolio is modified depending on the fluctuations in the interest rates. Income Funds invest in securities that come with a long maturity period and therefore, provide stable returns over time. The average maturity period of these funds is five years. Short-term and ultra short-term debt funds are those mutual funds that invest in securities that mature in one to three years. These funds are ideal for risk-averse investors. Liquid funds are debt funds that invest in assets and securities that mature within ninety-one days. These mutual funds generally invest in high-rated instruments. Liquid funds are a great option to park your surplus funds, and they offer higher returns than a regular savings bank account. Gilt Funds are debt funds that invest in high-rated government securities. It is for this reason that these funds possess lower levels of risk and are apt for risk-averse investors. Credit Opportunities Funds mostly invest in low rated securities that have the potential to provide higher returns. Naturally, these funds are the riskiest class of debt funds. Fixed maturity plans (FMPs) are close-ended debt funds that invest in fixed income securities such as government bonds. You may invest in FMPs only during the fund offer period, and the investment will be locked-in for a predefined period.\nBalanced or hybrid mutual funds:\nBalanced or hybrid mutual funds invest across both equity and debt instruments. The main objective of hybrid funds is to balance the risk-reward ratio by diversifying the portfolio. Equity-oriented hybrid funds are those that invest at least 65% of its portfolio in equities while the rest is invested in fixed-income instruments. Debt-oriented hybrid funds allocate at least 65% of its portfolio in fixed-income instruments such as treasury bills and government securities, and the rest is invested in equities. Monthly income plans (MIPs) majorly invest in debt instruments and aim at providing a steady return over time. The equity exposure is usually limited to under 20%. Arbitrage funds aim at maximising the returns by purchasing securities in one market at lower prices and selling them in another market at a premium. \nBased on Risk Profile:\nHigh-risk funds are funds which carry a high level of risk but generate impressive returns. These funds require active management and their performance must be reviewed regularly as these are prone to market volatility. The corpus of medium-risk funds is invested partly in debt and partly in equities. The average returns offered by these funds range from 9% to 12%. The corpus of low-risk funds is spread across a combination of arbitrage funds, ultra-short-term funds, and liquid funds. These funds are ideal in times of unexpected national crisis or when the rupee depreciates in value. Very Low-risk Funds could be ultra-short-term funds or liquid funds whose maturity extends from a month to a year. Such funds are virtually risk-free and the returns they offer are generally around 6% at the best.",

          "context": "48. SIP\n\nSystematic Investment Plan or SIP is a mode of investment in mutual funds in which a consumer can invest money in a scheme via periodic installments over a period of time. It is not a mutual fund scheme but a mode of investment into a Mutual Fund of your choice. SIP can be started with an amount as low as Rs. 100 or Rs 500. Investors who are looking for long-term investment with the objective of wealth creation. Although SIP can be adopted for investing in debt funds, it is a more suitable form of investment in equities. It is advisable to stay invested for a minimum of 3-5 years and avoid short-term investment. If you want to invest in mutual fund but can’t afford to cough a large amount at once, then you can start investing through SIP with minimum monthly installment of as low as ₹100 or ₹500 (it differs for every scheme). Each time an investor makes a payment, the fund manager purchases more units of the assets that is shares and securities of the firms the fund is invested in. This gradually increases the number of units owned by the investor and hence SIPs are suitable for the long term. \nBenefits of Investing via Systematic Investment Plan (SIP):\t\nThrough SIP, one invests periodic amounts instead of a larger sum. The fund manager can purchase more units of market-linked instruments (equities and debt) every time. More units are bought when stock prices are low and vice versa. Thus, a SIP enables you to lower the average cost of your investment and reduce the risk associated with market volatility by spreading the purchase price over time. This is known as rupee cost averaging. A SIP enables you to regularly increase your investment amount by a fixed amount. The returns are calculated on the amount invested plus the previous returns. Thus, the returns are compounded and this is the power of compounding of a SIP.\nTypes of SIP includes Top up SIP, Flexible SIP, Perpetual SIP, Trigger SIP. Top-up SIP allows you to increase the SIP amount at regular intervals and take advantage of a well-performing mutual fund scheme by increasing your investment amount.  Flexible SIP allows you to increase or decrease the SIP amount as per your disposable income. Thus, with this SIP, you can decrease or skip the payment of a few installments when there is a cash crunch. Similarly, this mode also allows you to increase the SIP amount during an increase in cash inflows. While making a SIP investment, investors have a choice to provide the end date of the SIP. If the investor chooses to not give an end date then it is a perpetual SIP. This allows you to end your SIP at the time of your choice or when your financial goal is achieved since there is no fixed tenure attached. Trigger SIP is better suited for investors who have knowledge and awareness of financial markets. It allows you to set either an index level, NAV or a particular date as the start date of the SIP. However, it is not advisable to invest via a trigger SIP as it is essentially an attempt to time the market which is nearly impossible to do with 100% accuracy\nThe tax on SIPs depends on the nature of the mutual fund scheme – equity or non-equity. You can read about the tax treatment of equity and non-equity mutual funds here.\nMostly SIPs are used for equity funds and as per tax rules of all equity funds, capital gains up to Rs. 1 Lakh (after 1 year) are exempted from taxation, and the rest are taxed at 10% as per the taxation norms of Equity Funds. If the s/he redeems the fund in less than a year (ELSS are locked in for 3 years), then the capital gains will be taxed at 15% and no tax exemption will be provided. You can miss up to 3 installments. Automated SIP installment may get missed because of low account balance. In this case, banks may charge for not maintaining minimum balance. Some AMCs allow the option of pausing SIP installments for about a few months (3 to 6) for some schemes. Tax Saver SIPs also known as Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) are the only SIP plans with tax saving benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. It also comes with a lock-in period of 3 years.",

They provide short-term loans to agriculture and related industries. Cooperative banks' principal purpose is to enhance social welfare by providing low-interest loans. They are arranged in a three-tiered system. State Cooperative Banks forms Tier 1 regulated by The RBI, the government, and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) all contribute to the project's funding.

They look after all sectors, from rural to urban. Unless the RBI directs otherwise, these banks do not charge concessional interest rates. These banks' primary source of funds is public deposits. Commercial banks are further classified into three types. Public sector banks are those in which the government or the country's central bank owns the majority of the stock.\nBanks in the private sector are those in which a private entity, an individual, or a group of people owns the majority of the stock.

RRBs were founded in 1975 and are governed by the 1976 Regional Rural Bank Act.\nRRBs are 50/50 joint ventures between the federal government and state governments (15%), as well as a commercial bank (35 percent ).\nBetween 1987 and 2005, 196 RRBs were established. From 2005 forward, the government began merging RRBs, bringing the total number of RRBs to 82. A single RRB cannot open branches in more than three districts that are geographically connected.\nLocal Area Banks (LAB):\nIn India, it was first introduced in 1996. The private sector organizes these. Local Area Banks' primary goal is to make a profit. Local Area Banks are governed by the 1956 Companies Act.

Specialized banks are the name for several types of financial institutions. Small Industries Development Bank of India or SIDBI can provide a loan for a small-scale enterprise or business. With the support of this bank, small businesses can get current technology and equipment. The Export and Import Bank or EXIM Bank stands for Export and Import Bank. This type of bank can provide loans or other financial help to foreign countries that are exporting or importing goods.\nNABARD or National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development provides financial support for rural, handicraft, village, and agricultural development.
