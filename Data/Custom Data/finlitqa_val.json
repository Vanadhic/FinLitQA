Banking Cards are preferred because of multiple reasons, including, but not limited to, convenience, portability, safety, and security. This is the only mode of digital payment that is popular in online transactions and physical transactions alike. Nowadays, many apps are being launched with the sole purpose of managing card transactions like Cred, Square, etc. Unstructured Supplementary Service Data(USSD) was launched for those sections of India\u2019s population which don\u2019t have access to proper banking and internet facilities. Under USSD, mobile banking transactions are possible without an internet connection by simply dialing *99# on any essential feature phone. Around 51 leading banks offer USSD service in 12 different languages, including Hindi & English. Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) is a bank-led model for digital payments that was initiated to leverage the presence and reach of Aadhar. AEPS doesn\u2019t require any physical activity like visiting a branch, using debit or credit cards or making a signature on a document. This bank-led model allows digital payments at PoS (Point of Sale / Micro ATM) via a Business Correspondent(also known as Bank Mitra) using Aadhaar authentication. The AePS fees for Cash withdrawal at BC Points are around Rs.15.\nUPI is a payment system that culminates numerous bank accounts into a single application, allowing the transfer of money easily between any two parties. The benefit of using UPI is that it allows you to pay directly from your bank account, without the need to type in the card or bank details. \nMobile Wallets, as the name suggests, are a type of wallet in which you can carry cash but in a digital format. Often customers link their bank accounts or banking cards to the wallet to facilitate secure digital transactions. Another way to use wallets is to add money to the Mobile Wallet and use the said balance to transfer money. Nowadays, many banks have launched their wallets. Additionally, notable private companies have also established their presence in the Mobile Wallet space. Some popularly used ones include Paytm, Freecharge, Mobikwik, mRupee, Vodafone M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Jio Money, SBI Buddy, Vodafone M-Pesa, Axis Bank Lime, ICICI Pockets, etc. A bank prepaid card is a pre-loaded debit card issued by a bank, usually single-use or reloadable for multiple uses. It is different from a standard debit card because the latter is always linked with your bank account and can be used numerous times. PoS(Point of Sale) is known as the location or segment where a sale happens. For a long time, PoS terminals were considered to be the checkout counters in malls and stores where the payment was made. First is the contactless reader of a PoS machine, which can debit any amount up to Rs. 2000 by auto-authenticating it, without the need of a Card PIN. Internet Banking, also known as e-banking or online banking, allows the customers of a particular bank to make transactions and conduct other financial activities via the bank\u2019s website. NEFT, RTGS, or IMPS are some of the top ways to make transactions via internet banking. Mobile banking refers to the act of conducting transactions and other banking activities via mobile devices, typically through the bank\u2019s mobile app. Digital payment methods, such as IMPS, NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, investments, bank statements, bill payments, etc., are available on a single platform in mobile banking apps. Micro ATM is a device for Business Correspondents (BC) to deliver essential banking services to customers. These Correspondents, who could even be a local store owner, will serve as a  \u2018micro ATM\u2019 to conduct instant transactions. They will use a device that will let you transfer money via your Aadhaar linked bank account by merely authenticating your fingerprint. The only requirement for Micro ATMs is that you should link your bank account to Aadhaar.", "question": "How many languages are included for USSD service?", "answers": {"text": ["12 different languages, including Hindi & English"], "answer_start": [843]}},

These funds tend to offer the benefits of stability and liquidity to their investors. Money market funds generate income from interest payments and capital gains. Also, the interest rates and the market price of these funds go hand in hand. When the interest rate rises, the market price of these funds increases, allowing the investor to earn through higher interest income. When the interest rate falls, the market price of money market funds decreases. It must be noted that higher the interest rate, higher will be the income generated by the investor. This can, therefore, be considered as the ideal time for investing in money market funds. Money market funds deal with bulk orders and require investors to pool in a huge amount of money; hence, they are suitable for large corporates and retail investors rather than individual investors\nIf you are an investor with a medium to long investment horizon, you may consider investing in dynamic bond funds or balanced funds instead of money market funds which may offer better returns. Money market funds are suitable only for investors with a short term investment horizon i.e. 3 months to 1 year. Liquid Funds have a maturity period of 91 days, whereas Money Market Funds mature in a time period of one year. Liquid funds are a type of mutual funds that invest in money market securities with a comparatively shorter investment duration. These funds are known to allow their investors to withdraw their funds on a very short notice. Money market funds are highly liquid assets. Money market funds are fixed income investment instruments that offer a fixed rate of interest decided by the RBI. Additionally, these instruments also pay out their earnings in the form of dividends, which do not qualify for a tax break.The interest rate on money market funds is decided by the RBI and is generally calculated on an everyday basis. This interest amount is paid directly into the accounts of the investors at the end of each month.\nFunctions of Money market:\nIt provides trade financing. Modern day money markets play a vital role in ensuring that there is adequate capital available to institutions engaged in domestic as well as international trade. Internationally, short term funding for ventures may be available to traders through \u2018bills of exchange\u2019 apart from other routes. These are instruments that are discounted by the bill market.It Ensures Industrial Financing. \nMany industries and industrial houses issue bonds on the bond market or shares on the stock market in order to receive long term financing of their operations. There are two ways in which money markets help with industrial financing- providing short term funding and producing an impact on capital markets. Short term funding from money markets can help industries finance their day to day operations and meet working capital requirements. The long term capital is obtained by industries through the issue of bonds or shares on applicable capital markets. High Liquidity Investment Solution:\nThe money market offers a lucrative, low risk route to institutions such as commercial banks in using their excess funds to earn additional income. It ensures self sufficiency of banks. Commercial banks operating in developed money markets have ample opportunities to invest and generate further income such that their self sufficiency improves in the long term. In case of dire cash crunch, banks can borrow funds from the RBI. It Maintains Money Supply for Central Banks. Central Banks are responsible for maintaining and controlling both the money market and capital market. As these markets operate using short term interest rates, they serve as an indicator of the country\u2019s overall economic health.

These funds are debt securities offering a fixed rate of interest and hence, are used as tools for raising capital by the issuer. However, money market funds are generally unsecured and involve a theoretically high risk of non-repayment. While there is also no collateral backing up of the security in these funds, they tend to offer a high credit rating ensuring that issuers don\u2019t default, which makes them a go-to avenue for investors looking for options to park their money for short term and earn fixed returns on the same. Money market instruments, also known as long term borrowing instruments are grouped as \u2018papers\u2019 in contrast to \u2018bonds\u2019 and \u2018shares\u2019 and are traded on capital markets. One of the core drivers of money markets is inter-bank lending. Inter-bank lending refers to banks lending to and borrowing from other banks using money market instruments such as repurchase agreements and commercial papers. In India, the RBI regulates the REPO rate which is a benchmark rate to be used by domestic banks for the purpose of lending and borrowing from one another.\nFeatures of Money Market Funds:\nThe maturity period of one year offered by these funds makes them highly liquid. Additionally, these funds tend to generate fixed income for the investors in such a short period; owing to which they are taken for close substitutes of money. Moreover, it is easy to trade money market instruments across currencies, maturities, debt structure as well as credit risk, which makes it ideal for institutions seeking to borrow or invest for the short term. These financial instruments are considered one of the most secure investment avenues available in the market. Since issuers of money market instruments have a high credit rating and the returns are fixed beforehand, the risk of losing the invested capital is minuscule. Since money market instruments are offered at a discount to the face value, the amount that the investor gets on maturity is decided in advance. Money markets across the world essentially operate over the counter, which implies that the trading of these funds cannot be made online. Hence, investments in the money market are made physically by authorized representatives or in person. Later, a physical certificate is issued to the buyer of the money market instrument. Money markets are designed to provide and accept bulk orders. Thus, retail investors who have enough capital can directly participate in money markets, while individual investors must invest in debt mutual funds that invest in money markets in order to benefit from this market. Unlike capital markets which usually trade in one single type of instrument, money markets trade is multiple instruments. These instruments differ in terms of maturity periods, debt structure, credit risk, currency, among others. Money market instruments are therefore considered ideal for diversification through exposure.Since money markets deal with only bulk orders, they are not open to individual investors. As a result of which, multiple institutional investors such as financial institutions and dealers looking to borrow or lend money for a short term participate in the trading of these instruments.\nThe Indian money market is controlled and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. One of the most crucial functions of the money market is to maintain liquidity in the economy. Some of the money market instruments are an important part of the monetary policy framework. RBI uses these short-term securities to get liquidity in the market within the required range. Money markets allow investors to withdraw their funds on very short notice. Hence, it is advised that institutions borrow funds from the market instead of borrowing from banks, as the process is hassle-free and the interest rate is also lower than that of commercial loans. Sometimes, commercial banks also use these money market instruments to maintain the minimum cash reserve ratio as per the RBI guidelines. Money Market makes it easier for investors to dispose of their surplus funds while retaining their liquid nature and offering significant profits on the same. It facilitates investors\u2019 (such as banks, non-financial corporations, state and local government) savings into investment channels. The money market enables financial mobility to investors by allowing easy transfer of funds from one sector to another, thereby ensuring transparency in the system. High financial mobility is important for the overall growth of the economy as it promotes industrial and commercial development. A developed money market helps RBI in efficiently implementing monetary policies.

MONEY_MARKET_INSTRUMENTS\n\nTreasury Bills:\nTreasury bills or T-bills are issued by the Reserve Bank of India on behalf of the Central Government for raising money. T-bills do not pay any interest but are available at a discount to the face value at the time of issue. At maturity, the investor gets the face value amount. This difference between the initial value and face value is the return earned by the investor. Treasury Bills are by far the oldest of money market instruments and are considered to be the safest short term fixed income investments as they are backed by the Government of India. Since T-bills are issued by the government, they offer guaranteed returns and are known to be zero default risk investments. Additionally, T-bills have a short maturity period of up to 1 year. T-Bills are commonly classified on the basis of their maturity period and their type. The maturity-based classification of treasury bills names them as 10-day TBs, 91-day TBs, 182-day TBs, and 364-day TBs. The other classification includes auction bills and tap bills. Auction bills follow a multiple price system in order to ensure fair pricing. These bills are also termed as regular bills as they are available for investment by banks and other participating institutions\nCommercial Papers:\nLarge companies and businesses issue promissory notes to raise capital from investors in order to meet their short term business needs. These promissory notes are known as Commercial Papers (CPs)\nThe firms issuing commercial papers have a high credit rating, owing to which they are unsecured, with the company\u2019s credibility acting as security for the financial instrument\nCorporates, primary dealers (PDs) and All-India Financial Institutions (FIs) can issue CPs. CPs have a fixed maturity period ranging from 7 days to 270 days. However, investors can trade this instrument in the secondary market, wherever they offer relatively higher returns compared to that from treasury bills\nCertificate of Deposit (CD):\nCertificates of deposit are financial assets issued by banks and financial institutions, offering a fixed interest rate on the invested amount, similar to a fixed deposit\nThe primary difference between a CD and a Fixed Deposit is that of the principal amount. A certificate of deposit is issued only for large sums of money (1 lakh or in multiples of 1 lakh thereafter). The maturity period of Certificates of Deposits ranges from 7 days to 1 year if issued by banks. However, other financial institutions also issue a CD with a maturity period of 1 year to 3 years\nRepurchase Agreements or Ready Forward Contract (Repo):\nAlso known as repos or buybacks, a Repurchase Agreement is a formal agreement between two parties, where one party sells a security to another, with the promise of buying it back at a later date. It is also called a Sell-Buy transaction. The seller buys the security at a predetermined time and amount which also includes the interest rate at which the buyer agreed to buy the security. The interest rate charged by the buyer for agreeing to buy the security is called Repo rate. \nBanker\u2019s Acceptance:\nThis is a financial instrument produced by an individual or a corporation in the name of the bank, wherein the issuer must pay a specified amount to the instrument holder on a predetermined date, between 30 and 180 days, starting from the date of issue of the instrument. Banker\u2019s Acceptance is issued at a discounted price, and the actual price is paid to the holder at maturity. The difference between the two is the profit made by the investor. Banker\u2019s acceptance is a secure financial instrument as the payment is guaranteed by a commercial bank\nCall Money:\nCall money essentially represents a short term loan for the purpose of making stock exchange transactions with maturities ranging from 1 day to 14 days and is repayable on demand. The call money market participants are allowed to lend and borrow using the call money instruments such as STCI (Securities Trading Corporation of India), DFHI (Discount and Finance House of India), co-operative banks and Indian and foreign commercial banks. Call money loans feature a fixed interest rate, termed as call rate, which being closely related to changes in demand and supply, is quite volatile. Due to this high level of volatility, the call money market is considered to be the most sensitive section of India\u2019s money market\nInterest Rate Swaps:\nInterest rate swap is referred to a financial transaction in which two parties sign a deal wherein one pays a fixed rate of interest, and the other pays a floating rate of interest. The fixed rate of interest payable is calculated using a notional principal amount, while the floating rate of interest is paid on the actual principal lent out/borrowed with the rate varying on the basis of market conditions. In India, interest rate swaps are mainly used by commercial banks. However, these are separate products that are not directly linked to the bank\u2019s assets such as money lent to customers in the form of loans.\nThis money market instrument protects the borrower from interest rates changes even though the borrower is on the hook for any variable markup payments not covered by the interest rate swap agreement.\n", "question": "Who issues Treasury bills?", "answers": {"text": ["the Reserve Bank of India "], "answer_start": [86]}},

MONEY_MARKET_INSTRUMENTS\n\nTreasury Bills:\nTreasury bills or T-bills are issued by the Reserve Bank of India on behalf of the Central Government for raising money. T-bills do not pay any interest but are available at a discount to the face value at the time of issue. At maturity, the investor gets the face value amount. This difference between the initial value and face value is the return earned by the investor. Treasury Bills are by far the oldest of money market instruments and are considered to be the safest short term fixed income investments as they are backed by the Government of India. Since T-bills are issued by the government, they offer guaranteed returns and are known to be zero default risk investments. Additionally, T-bills have a short maturity period of up to 1 year. T-Bills are commonly classified on the basis of their maturity period and their type. The maturity-based classification of treasury bills names them as 10-day TBs, 91-day TBs, 182-day TBs, and 364-day TBs. The other classification includes auction bills and tap bills. Auction bills follow a multiple price system in order to ensure fair pricing. These bills are also termed as regular bills as they are available for investment by banks and other participating institutions\nCommercial Papers:\nLarge companies and businesses issue promissory notes to raise capital from investors in order to meet their short term business needs. These promissory notes are known as Commercial Papers (CPs)\nThe firms issuing commercial papers have a high credit rating, owing to which they are unsecured, with the company\u2019s credibility acting as security for the financial instrument\nCorporates, primary dealers (PDs) and All-India Financial Institutions (FIs) can issue CPs. CPs have a fixed maturity period ranging from 7 days to 270 days. However, investors can trade this instrument in the secondary market, wherever they offer relatively higher returns compared to that from treasury bills\nCertificate of Deposit (CD):\nCertificates of deposit are financial assets issued by banks and financial institutions, offering a fixed interest rate on the invested amount, similar to a fixed deposit\nThe primary difference between a CD and a Fixed Deposit is that of the principal amount. A certificate of deposit is issued only for large sums of money (1 lakh or in multiples of 1 lakh thereafter). The maturity period of Certificates of Deposits ranges from 7 days to 1 year if issued by banks. However, other financial institutions also issue a CD with a maturity period of 1 year to 3 years\nRepurchase Agreements or Ready Forward Contract (Repo):\nAlso known as repos or buybacks, a Repurchase Agreement is a formal agreement between two parties, where one party sells a security to another, with the promise of buying it back at a later date. It is also called a Sell-Buy transaction. The seller buys the security at a predetermined time and amount which also includes the interest rate at which the buyer agreed to buy the security. The interest rate charged by the buyer for agreeing to buy the security is called Repo rate. \nBanker\u2019s Acceptance:\nThis is a financial instrument produced by an individual or a corporation in the name of the bank, wherein the issuer must pay a specified amount to the instrument holder on a predetermined date, between 30 and 180 days, starting from the date of issue of the instrument. Banker\u2019s Acceptance is issued at a discounted price, and the actual price is paid to the holder at maturity. The difference between the two is the profit made by the investor. Banker\u2019s acceptance is a secure financial instrument as the payment is guaranteed by a commercial bank\nCall Money:\nCall money essentially represents a short term loan for the purpose of making stock exchange transactions with maturities ranging from 1 day to 14 days and is repayable on demand. The call money market participants are allowed to lend and borrow using the call money instruments such as STCI (Securities Trading Corporation of India), DFHI (Discount and Finance House of India), co-operative banks and Indian and foreign commercial banks. Call money loans feature a fixed interest rate, termed as call rate, which being closely related to changes in demand and supply, is quite volatile. Due to this high level of volatility, the call money market is considered to be the most sensitive section of India\u2019s money market\nInterest Rate Swaps:\nInterest rate swap is referred to a financial transaction in which two parties sign a deal wherein one pays a fixed rate of interest, and the other pays a floating rate of interest. The fixed rate of interest payable is calculated using a notional principal amount, while the floating rate of interest is paid on the actual principal lent out/borrowed with the rate varying on the basis of market conditions. In India, interest rate swaps are mainly used by commercial banks. However, these are separate products that are not directly linked to the bank\u2019s assets such as money lent to customers in the form of loans.\nThis money market instrument protects the borrower from interest rates changes even though the borrower is on the hook for any variable markup payments not covered by the interest rate swap agreement.\n", "question": "What is the maturity period of Commercial papers?", "answers": {"text": ["7 days to 270 days"], "answer_start": [1802]}},

Financial assets can be divided into market-linked products (such as stocks and mutual fund) and fixed income products (like Public Provident Fund, bank fixed deposits). Non-financial assets - many Indians invest via this mode - are the likes of physical gold and real estate.\nAny investment is the act of buying or creating assets with an expectation that the same would yield interest earnings or dividend or capital appreciation or any other return that is profitable as compared to the money put in initially. While saving may be understood as a passive way of accumulating wealth, investment can be seen as a more aggressive way of securing returns. Mostly, under savings, customers avail a savings account and stash away cash in it. The two types of Investments are Traditional and Alternative Investments.\nTraditional Investments:\nInvesting in well-known financial products falls into the category of traditional investments. A Bond can be understood as an IOU which is issued by an issuer (borrower) and to a lender. Generally, bonds are instruments used by public and private sector enterprises to raise huge sums of money which any bank is incapable of lending. These bonds are then issued in the public market by the borrowing entity and are bought by lenders for specific amounts of money. Bonds fall under the category of fixed income securities since the interest on these can be exactly calculated for the time for which the bond is held.  Stocks or equity are shares that are issued by companies and are bought by the general public. This offers an avenue to companies to raise funds. Stocks entitle a customer ownership of a company. Shares, stocks and equity all imply the same thing. to balance out the high return associated with stocks, the risk associated with these products is also quite high.\nSome of the most common small savings tools are Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme, EPF (Employees Provident Fund), NPS (National Pension Scheme, Kisan Vikas Patra, Personal Provident Fund (PPF) etc. Almost all small savings schemes are initiated and facilitated by the government. Mutual funds are financial instruments that are professionally managed and that invest money on behalf of any investor, in different securities. Some of the most popular mutual fund types are balanced funds, stock funds, open-ended funds etc. So, an equity fund invests purely is equity and is a high risk high return product while a debt fund invests purely in debt and money market instruments and is hence a low risk low return financial product.\nIn fixed deposits a fixed amount of money is kept aside with a financial institution for a fixed number of days or months or years. Customers who do not have a large chunk of money to fix in a single go can opt for a recurring deposit wherein money is usually deposited monthly for a specific deposit tenure. Real estat is a traditional investment. Property rates are soaring with every passing day which has made real estate a hot investment avenue for investors. Buying, selling and leasing of property offers substantial returns to investors. Appreciation of property makes real estate a good investment tool. \nAlternative Investments:\nAlternative Investments are those that are not regular investments like stocks, bonds etc and complex in nature. It has relatively low liquidity and well as very high minimum investment limits.\nHedge Funds can be understood as a professionally managed private investment company or partnership structure. Techniques to manage the fund can be those that are not commonly allowed for SEC regulated companies. Hedge funds invest in both financial derivatives and/or publicly traded securities. These are popular as an alternative investment tool owing to their high leverage and high returns. However, they are characterized by high fees as well as low liquidity. Private equity is trading in shares of an operating company that is not publicly listed and whose shares are not available on the stock market. Institutional investors employ various strategies to indulge in private equity trading. The idea behind Venture Capital is this investment strategy is to invest substantial capital in a budding company in return for stocks of the same. This is done with companies who are either in their initiation phase or in their growth phase. Managed Futures involves managers using futures also as part of their investment portfolio. In general, a managed futures account will have sufficient exposure to different markets like energy, agriculture, commodities, currency etc. Structured products are alternative investment tools that generally combine two or more financial instruments to make a packaged investment strategy in a single product. Most often, derivatives are combined with securities or with other derivatives. Structured products have a fixed maturity date like bonds. Collectible items or Collecting artifacts that have substantial value and those that have historical and artistic significance is one of the most difficult types of alternative investments. This requires knowledge of the article that you are purchasing. Mostly, collectibles like stamps, jewelry, boats, planes, art works etc. tend to appreciate in value and are considered good and profitable assets to own. The value of artifacts is generally expected to appreciate and keep pace with inflation and hence collectibles make a good form of alternative investment.", "question": "What is meant by stocks?", "answers": {"text": ["Stocks or equity are shares that are issued by companies and are bought by the general public"], "answer_start": [1588]}},

{"id": 272321, "title": "Title", "context": "44. NPS\n\nThe NPS invests the contributions of its subscribers into various market-linked instruments such as equities and debts and the final pension amount depends on the performance of these investments. It has an applicable interest rate of 12% to 14% on contributions made. Any Indian citizen in the age group of 18-60 can open an NPS account. NPS is administered and regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory Authority of India (PFRDA). The NPS matures at the age of 60 but can be extended until the age of 70. The scheme does not offer a fixed interest rate and is available between 12% to 14%. This Rate of interest is apparently higher than the ROI offered by many other saving schemes. Money contributed to the NPS account can be invested in up to 4 asset classes \u2013 equities, corporate bonds, government bonds and alternative assets through various pension funds. Out of the 4 asset classes the allocation to equities cannot be more than 75% of the corpus and that too is valid only up to 50 years of age. From 51 years onwards the allocation to equity starts tapering off as per a defined matrix. Similarly, your contribution towards Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) cannot be more than 5% of your corpus. NPS does not have a fixed interest rate but the returns are market-linked. \nTypes of NPS Accounts:\nTier I Account: This account carries a tax deduction under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum and an additional amount up to Rs 50,000 per annum under Section 80CCD (1B). This is a non-withdrawable permanent retirement account. On maturity i.e at the age of 60, 60% of the corpus which is tax-free can be withdrawn. Another 40% must mandatorily be used to buy an annuity. The balance 20% can either be used to buy an annuity or can be withdrawn after paying tax. In NPS Tier 1, the minimum initial contribution is Rs 500. However, the minimum annual contribution to your NPS Tier I account is Rs 1,000. There is no maximum annual contribution. The minimum amount per contribution is Rs 500.\nTier II Account: This is a voluntary retirement-cum-savings account that can be opened only if you have a Tier I account. Subscribers are free to invest or withdraw their funds anytime according to their convenience. In NPS Tier 2, the minimum initial contribution is Rs 1,000. There is no minimum or maximum annual contribution. The minimum amount per contribution is Rs 250.\nNPS Charges:\nPension Fund Manager fees are capped at 0.01% compared to 2-2.5% for mutual funds. NPS investments are market-linked hence their returns cannot be predicted in advance. Thus the expected rate of return (expressed as a percentage value) is used to calculate the future corpus value of your NPS contributions. Higher the value in this field, higher is the final corpus size. Annuity Purchase percentage figure indicates the portion of your NPS future corpus that will be used to purchase annuities that determine your monthly pension after retirement. Under existing rules, a minimum 40% of NPS corpus is to be mandatorily used for the purchase of annuities. Higher the portion of NPS future corpus used for annuity purchase, greater will be the monthly pension that you will get.\nNational Pension Schemes Benefits:\nNPS is a beneficial scheme to invest in as the investments are made into equities which can be risky but also offer higher returns as compared to other tax-saving investment schemes like Public Provident Fund. So far, the scheme has delivered 8% to 10% annualized returns. The tax benefits available under NPS are the most important reason why one should consider investing in this scheme. As a long-term investment scheme, it allows a tax deduction of a maximum Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2). Moreover, the subscribers are eligible to get an additional benefit of Rs.50,000 which can be claimed by the investor as tax benefit under Section 80CCD(1B). Since it is a pension scheme, you must keep yourself invested until the age of 60 years. However, NPS allows the subscribers to make premature partial withdrawals under special cases. A maximum of 25% of the accumulated amount can be partially withdrawn after completion of at least 5 years of continuous contributions in the fund. The same can be processed to furnish Child\u2019s marriage, Higher education, buying house or medical emergencies. You can invest in both NPS and APY and other retirement vehicles like EPF or PPF. There is no bar to this. In the event of the death of the subscriber, the nominee will receive the entire accumulated pension wealth. If the subscriber has not declared a nominee then it will go to the legal heir of the subscriber. In both the cases, there would not be any requirement for purchasing an annuity or a monthly pension plan.\n", "question": "Where does NPS invest?", "answers": {"text": ["invested in up to 4 asset classes \u2013 equities, corporate bonds, government bonds and alternative assets through various pension funds"], "answer_start": [738]}},

Another 40% must mandatorily be used to buy an annuity. The balance 20% can either be used to buy an annuity or can be withdrawn after paying tax. In NPS Tier 1, the minimum initial contribution is Rs 500. However, the minimum annual contribution to your NPS Tier I account is Rs 1,000. There is no maximum annual contribution.

Higher the value in this field, higher is the final corpus size. Annuity Purchase percentage figure indicates the portion of your NPS future corpus that will be used to purchase annuities that determine your monthly pension after retirement. Under existing rules, a minimum 40% of NPS corpus is to be mandatorily used for the purchase of annuities. Higher the portion of NPS future corpus used for annuity purchase, greater will be the monthly pension that you will get.\nNational Pension Schemes Benefits:\nNPS is a beneficial scheme to invest in as the investments are made into equities which can be risky but also offer higher returns as compared to other tax-saving investment schemes like Public Provident Fund. So far, the scheme has delivered 8% to 10% annualized returns. The tax benefits available under NPS are the most important reason why one should consider investing in this scheme. As a long-term investment scheme, it allows a tax deduction of a maximum Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2). Moreover, the subscribers are eligible to get an additional benefit of Rs.50,000 which can be claimed by the investor as tax benefit under Section 80CCD(1B). Since it is a pension scheme, you must keep yourself invested until the age of 60 years. However, NPS allows the subscribers to make premature partial withdrawals under special cases. A maximum of 25% of the accumulated amount can be partially withdrawn after completion of at least 5 years of continuous contributions in the fund. The same can be processed to furnish Child\u2019s marriage, Higher education, buying house or medical emergencies. You can invest in both NPS and APY and other retirement vehicles like EPF or PPF. There is no bar to this. In the event of the death of the subscriber, the nominee will receive the entire accumulated pension wealth.

{"id": 272327, "title": "Title", "context": "44. NPS\n\nThe NPS invests the contributions of its subscribers into various market-linked instruments such as equities and debts and the final pension amount depends on the performance of these investments. It has an applicable interest rate of 12% to 14% on contributions made. Any Indian citizen in the age group of 18-60 can open an NPS account. NPS is administered and regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory Authority of India (PFRDA). The NPS matures at the age of 60 but can be extended until the age of 70. The scheme does not offer a fixed interest rate and is available between 12% to 14%. This Rate of interest is apparently higher than the ROI offered by many other saving schemes. Money contributed to the NPS account can be invested in up to 4 asset classes \u2013 equities, corporate bonds, government bonds and alternative assets through various pension funds. Out of the 4 asset classes the allocation to equities cannot be more than 75% of the corpus and that too is valid only up to 50 years of age. From 51 years onwards the allocation to equity starts tapering off as per a defined matrix. Similarly, your contribution towards Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) cannot be more than 5% of your corpus. NPS does not have a fixed interest rate but the returns are market-linked. \nTypes of NPS Accounts:\nTier I Account: This account carries a tax deduction under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum and an additional amount up to Rs 50,000 per annum under Section 80CCD (1B). This is a non-withdrawable permanent retirement account. On maturity i.e at the age of 60, 60% of the corpus which is tax-free can be withdrawn. Another 40% must mandatorily be used to buy an annuity. The balance 20% can either be used to buy an annuity or can be withdrawn after paying tax. In NPS Tier 1, the minimum initial contribution is Rs 500. However, the minimum annual contribution to your NPS Tier I account is Rs 1,000. There is no maximum annual contribution. The minimum amount per contribution is Rs 500.\nTier II Account: This is a voluntary retirement-cum-savings account that can be opened only if you have a Tier I account. Subscribers are free to invest or withdraw their funds anytime according to their convenience. In NPS Tier 2, the minimum initial contribution is Rs 1,000. There is no minimum or maximum annual contribution. The minimum amount per contribution is Rs 250.\nNPS Charges:\nPension Fund Manager fees are capped at 0.01% compared to 2-2.5% for mutual funds. NPS investments are market-linked hence their returns cannot be predicted in advance. Thus the expected rate of return (expressed as a percentage value) is used to calculate the future corpus value of your NPS contributions. Higher the value in this field, higher is the final corpus size. Annuity Purchase percentage figure indicates the portion of your NPS future corpus that will be used to purchase annuities that determine your monthly pension after retirement. Under existing rules, a minimum 40% of NPS corpus is to be mandatorily used for the purchase of annuities. Higher the portion of NPS future corpus used for annuity purchase, greater will be the monthly pension that you will get.\nNational Pension Schemes Benefits:\nNPS is a beneficial scheme to invest in as the investments are made into equities which can be risky but also offer higher returns as compared to other tax-saving investment schemes like Public Provident Fund. So far, the scheme has delivered 8% to 10% annualized returns. The tax benefits available under NPS are the most important reason why one should consider investing in this scheme. As a long-term investment scheme, it allows a tax deduction of a maximum Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2). Moreover, the subscribers are eligible to get an additional benefit of Rs.50,000 which can be claimed by the investor as tax benefit under Section 80CCD(1B). Since it is a pension scheme, you must keep yourself invested until the age of 60 years. However, NPS allows the subscribers to make premature partial withdrawals under special cases. A maximum of 25% of the accumulated amount can be partially withdrawn after completion of at least 5 years of continuous contributions in the fund. The same can be processed to furnish Child\u2019s marriage, Higher education, buying house or medical emergencies. You can invest in both NPS and APY and other retirement vehicles like EPF or PPF. There is no bar to this. In the event of the death of the subscriber, the nominee will receive the entire accumulated pension wealth.

Higher the portion of NPS future corpus used for annuity purchase, greater will be the monthly pension that you will get.\nNational Pension Schemes Benefits:\nNPS is a beneficial scheme to invest in as the investments are made into equities which can be risky but also offer higher returns as compared to other tax-saving investment schemes like Public Provident Fund. So far, the scheme has delivered 8% to 10% annualized returns. The tax benefits available under NPS are the most important reason why one should consider investing in this scheme. As a long-term investment scheme, it allows a tax deduction of a maximum Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C, 80CCD(1) and 80CCD(2). Moreover, the subscribers are eligible to get an additional benefit of Rs.50,000 which can be claimed by the investor as tax benefit under Section 80CCD(1B). Since it is a pension scheme, you must keep yourself invested until the age of 60 years. However, NPS allows the subscribers to make premature partial withdrawals under special cases. A maximum of 25% of the accumulated amount can be partially withdrawn after completion of at least 5 years of continuous contributions in the fund. The same can be processed to furnish Child\u2019s marriage, Higher education, buying house or medical emergencies. You can invest in both NPS and APY and other retirement vehicles like EPF or PPF. There is no bar to this. In the event of the death of the subscriber, the nominee will receive the entire accumulated pension wealth.

NPS\n\nThe NPS invests the contributions of its subscribers into various market-linked instruments such as equities and debts and the final pension amount depends on the performance of these investments.

{"id": 272369, "title": "Title", "context": "46. MUTUAL_FUNDS_TYPES\n\nMutual funds in India are broadly classified into equity funds, debt funds, money market funds and balanced mutual funds, depending on their asset allocation and equity exposure. \nEquity funds:\nAs the name suggests, invest mostly in equity shares of companies across all market capitalisations. A mutual fund is categorised under equity fund if it invests at least 65% of its portfolio in equity instruments. Equity funds have the potential to offer the highest returns among all classes of mutual funds. The returns provided by equity funds depend on the market movements, which are influenced by several geopolitical and economic factors. The equity funds are further classified into small cap, mid cap, large cap, multi cap funds.Small-cap funds are those equity funds that predominantly invest in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with small market capitalisation. SEBI defines small-cap companies as those that are ranked after 251 in market capitalisation. Mid-cap funds are those equity funds that invest primarily in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with medium market capitalisation. SEBI defines mid-cap companies as those that are ranked between 101 and 250 in market capitalisation. Large-cap funds are those equity funds that invest mostly in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with large market capitalisation. SEBI defines large-cap companies as those that are ranked between 1 and 100 in market capitalisation. Multi-Cap Funds invest substantially in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies across all market capitalisations. Sectoral funds invest principally in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies in a particular sector like FMCG and IT. Thematic funds invest in equities of companies that operate with a similar theme like travel. Index Funds are a type of equity funds having the intention of tracking and emulating the performance of a popular stock market index such as the S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty50. The asset allocation of an index fund would be the same as that of its underlying index. \nDebt Mutual Funds:\nDebt mutual funds invest mostly in debt, money market and other fixed-income instruments such as treasury bills, government bonds, certificates of deposit, and other high-rated securities. A mutual fund is considered a debt fund if it invests a minimum of 65% of its portfolio in debt securities. The debt funds are further classified as dynamic funds, Income funds, Liquid funds, short term funds, Gilt funds. Dynamic Bond Funds are those debt funds whose portfolio is modified depending on the fluctuations in the interest rates. Income Funds invest in securities that come with a long maturity period and therefore, provide stable returns over time. The average maturity period of these funds is five years. Short-term and ultra short-term debt funds are those mutual funds that invest in securities that mature in one to three years. These funds are ideal for risk-averse investors. Liquid funds are debt funds that invest in assets and securities that mature within ninety-one days. These mutual funds generally invest in high-rated instruments. Liquid funds are a great option to park your surplus funds, and they offer higher returns than a regular savings bank account. Gilt Funds are debt funds that invest in high-rated government securities. It is for this reason that these funds possess lower levels of risk and are apt for risk-averse investors. Credit Opportunities Funds mostly invest in low rated securities that have the potential to provide higher returns. Naturally, these funds are the riskiest class of debt funds. Fixed maturity plans (FMPs) are close-ended debt funds that invest in fixed income securities such as government bonds. You may invest in FMPs only during the fund offer period, and the investment will be locked-in for a predefined period.\nBalanced or hybrid mutual funds:\nBalanced or hybrid mutual funds invest across both equity and debt instruments. The main objective of hybrid funds is to balance the risk-reward ratio by diversifying the portfolio. Equity-oriented hybrid funds are those that invest at least 65% of its portfolio in equities while the rest is invested in fixed-income instruments. Debt-oriented hybrid funds allocate at least 65% of its portfolio in fixed-income instruments such as treasury bills and government securities, and the rest is invested in equities. Monthly income plans (MIPs) majorly invest in debt instruments and aim at providing a steady return over time. The equity exposure is usually limited to under 20%. Arbitrage funds aim at maximising the returns by purchasing securities in one market at lower prices and selling them in another market at a premium. \nBased on Risk Profile:\nHigh-risk funds are funds which carry a high level of risk but generate impressive returns. These funds require active management and their performance must be reviewed regularly as these are prone to market volatility. The corpus of medium-risk funds is invested partly in debt and partly in equities. The average returns offered by these funds range from 9% to 12%. The corpus of low-risk funds is spread across a combination of arbitrage funds, ultra-short-term funds, and liquid funds. These funds are ideal in times of unexpected national crisis or when the rupee depreciates in value. Very Low-risk Funds could be ultra-short-term funds or liquid funds whose maturity extends from a month to a year. Such funds are virtually risk-free and the returns they offer are generally around 6% at the best.", "question": "What is sectoral funds?", "answers": {"text": ["Sectoral funds invest principally in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies in a particular sector like FMCG and IT"], "answer_start": [1624]}},

SEBI defines large-cap companies as those that are ranked between 1 and 100 in market capitalisation. Multi-Cap Funds invest substantially in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies across all market capitalisations. Sectoral funds invest principally in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies in a particular sector like FMCG and IT. Thematic funds invest in equities of companies that operate with a similar theme like travel. Index Funds are a type of equity funds having the intention of tracking and emulating the performance of a popular stock market index such as the S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty50. The asset allocation of an index fund would be the same as that of its underlying index. \nDebt Mutual Funds:\nDebt mutual funds invest mostly in debt, money market and other fixed-income instruments such as treasury bills, government bonds, certificates of deposit, and other high-rated securities. A mutual fund is considered a debt fund if it invests a minimum of 65% of its portfolio in debt securities. The debt funds are further classified as dynamic funds, Income funds, Liquid funds, short term funds, Gilt funds. Dynamic Bond Funds are those debt funds whose portfolio is modified depending on the fluctuations in the interest rates. Income Funds invest in securities that come with a long maturity period and therefore, provide stable returns over time. The average maturity period of these funds is five years. Short-term and ultra short-term debt funds are those mutual funds that invest in securities that mature in one to three years. These funds are ideal for risk-averse investors. Liquid funds are debt funds that invest in assets and securities that mature within ninety-one days. These mutual funds generally invest in high-rated instruments. Liquid funds are a great option to park your surplus funds, and they offer higher returns than a regular savings bank account. Gilt Funds are debt funds that invest in high-rated government securities. It is for this reason that these funds possess lower levels of risk and are apt for risk-averse investors. Credit Opportunities Funds mostly invest in low rated securities that have the potential to provide higher returns. Naturally, these funds are the riskiest class of debt funds. Fixed maturity plans (FMPs) are close-ended debt funds that invest in fixed income securities such as government bonds. You may invest in FMPs only during the fund offer period, and the investment will be locked-in for a predefined period.\nBalanced or hybrid mutual funds:\nBalanced or hybrid mutual funds invest across both equity and debt instruments. The main objective of hybrid funds is to balance the risk-reward ratio by diversifying the portfolio. Equity-oriented hybrid funds are those that invest at least 65% of its portfolio in equities while the rest is invested in fixed-income instruments. Debt-oriented hybrid funds allocate at least 65% of its portfolio in fixed-income instruments such as treasury bills and government securities, and the rest is invested in equities. Monthly income plans (MIPs) majorly invest in debt instruments and aim at providing a steady return over time. The equity exposure is usually limited to under 20%. Arbitrage funds aim at maximising the returns by purchasing securities in one market at lower prices and selling them in another market at a premium. \nBased on Risk Profile:\nHigh-risk funds are funds which carry a high level of risk but generate impressive returns. These funds require active management and their performance must be reviewed regularly as these are prone to market volatility. The corpus of medium-risk funds is invested partly in debt and partly in equities. The average returns offered by these funds range from 9% to 12%. The corpus of low-risk funds is spread across a combination of arbitrage funds, ultra-short-term funds, and liquid funds. These funds are ideal in times of unexpected national crisis or when the rupee depreciates in value. Very Low-risk Funds could be ultra-short-term funds or liquid funds whose maturity extends from a month to a year. Such funds are virtually risk-free and the returns they offer are generally around 6% at the best.", "question": "What does Index fund track?", "answers": {"text": ["stock market index such as the S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty50"], "answer_start": [1961]}},

MUTUAL_FUNDS_TYPES\n\nMutual funds in India are broadly classified into equity funds, debt funds, money market funds and balanced mutual funds, depending on their asset allocation and equity exposure. \nEquity funds:\nAs the name suggests, invest mostly in equity shares of companies across all market capitalisations. A mutual fund is categorised under equity fund if it invests at least 65% of its portfolio in equity instruments. Equity funds have the potential to offer the highest returns among all classes of mutual funds. The returns provided by equity funds depend on the market movements, which are influenced by several geopolitical and economic factors. The equity funds are further classified into small cap, mid cap, large cap, multi cap funds.Small-cap funds are those equity funds that predominantly invest in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with small market capitalisation. SEBI defines small-cap companies as those that are ranked after 251 in market capitalisation. Mid-cap funds are those equity funds that invest primarily in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with medium market capitalisation. SEBI defines mid-cap companies as those that are ranked between 101 and 250 in market capitalisation. Large-cap funds are those equity funds that invest mostly in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies with large market capitalisation. SEBI defines large-cap companies as those that are ranked between 1 and 100 in market capitalisation. Multi-Cap Funds invest substantially in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies across all market capitalisations. Sectoral funds invest principally in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies in a particular sector like FMCG and IT. Thematic funds invest in equities of companies that operate with a similar theme like travel. Index Funds are a type of equity funds having the intention of tracking and emulating the performance of a popular stock market index such as the S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty50. The asset allocation of an index fund would be the same as that of its underlying index. \nDebt Mutual Funds:\nDebt mutual funds invest mostly in debt, money market and other fixed-income instruments such as treasury bills, government bonds, certificates of deposit, and other high-rated securities. A mutual fund is considered a debt fund if it invests a minimum of 65% of its portfolio in debt securities. The debt funds are further classified as dynamic funds, Income funds, Liquid funds, short term funds, Gilt funds. Dynamic Bond Funds are those debt funds whose portfolio is modified depending on the fluctuations in the interest rates. Income Funds invest in securities that come with a long maturity period and therefore, provide stable returns over time. The average maturity period of these funds is five years. Short-term and ultra short-term debt funds are those mutual funds that invest in securities that mature in one to three years. These funds are ideal for risk-averse investors. Liquid funds are debt funds that invest in assets and securities that mature within ninety-one days. These mutual funds generally invest in high-rated instruments. Liquid funds are a great option to park your surplus funds, and they offer higher returns than a regular savings bank account. Gilt Funds are debt funds that invest in high-rated government securities. It is for this reason that these funds possess lower levels of risk and are apt for risk-averse investors. Credit Opportunities Funds mostly invest in low rated securities that have the potential to provide higher returns. Naturally, these funds are the riskiest class of debt funds. Fixed maturity plans (FMPs) are close-ended debt funds that invest in fixed income securities such as government bonds. You may invest in FMPs only during the fund offer period, and the investment will be locked-in for a predefined period.\nBalanced or hybrid mutual funds:\nBalanced or hybrid mutual funds invest across both equity and debt instruments. The main objective of hybrid funds is to balance the risk-reward ratio by diversifying the portfolio. Equity-oriented hybrid funds are those that invest at least 65% of its portfolio in equities while the rest is invested in fixed-income instruments. Debt-oriented hybrid funds allocate at least 65% of its portfolio in fixed-income instruments such as treasury bills and government securities, and the rest is invested in equities. Monthly income plans (MIPs) majorly invest in debt instruments and aim at providing a steady return over time. The equity exposure is usually limited to under 20%. Arbitrage funds aim at maximising the returns by purchasing securities in one market at lower prices and selling them in another market at a premium. \nBased on Risk Profile:\nHigh-risk funds are funds which carry a high level of risk but generate impressive returns. These funds require active management and their performance must be reviewed regularly as these are prone to market volatility. The corpus of medium-risk funds is invested partly in debt and partly in equities. The average returns offered by these funds range from 9% to 12%. The corpus of low-risk funds is spread across a combination of arbitrage funds, ultra-short-term funds, and liquid funds. These funds are ideal in times of unexpected national crisis or when the rupee depreciates in value. Very Low-risk Funds could be ultra-short-term funds or liquid funds whose maturity extends from a month to a year.

INSURANCE\n\nInsurance refers to a mutual agreement or a policy that an individual purchases from an insurance company by paying premiums on yearly, monthly or quarterly basis to the insurance company. In return, the insurance company protects the buyer or the policyholder from any kind of loss or risk that may occur in the future. Apart from individuals, both public and private sector organization can purchase insurance to protect their employees. It's basically a kind risk management scheme by using which the insured person can get protection against possible eventualities such as loss, sickness, death, loss done to his/her belongings etc. Insurance is the only financial instrument that helps you manage your financial risks smoothly and reduces your financial worries.

General Insurance or Non-life Insurance: It helps you to safeguard yourself and the things around, which you value a lot. These may include your home, car and other valuables like money lending, professional casualties other than death, etc. The tenure for a general insurance is not like the tenure we have in life insurance.

SIP\n\nSystematic Investment Plan or SIP is a mode of investment in mutual funds in which a consumer can invest money in a scheme via periodic installments over a period of time.

Investors who are looking for long-term investment with the objective of wealth creation. Although SIP can be adopted for investing in debt funds, it is a more suitable form of investment in equities. It is advisable to stay invested for a minimum of 3-5 years and avoid short-term investment. If you want to invest in mutual fund but can\u2019t afford to cough a large amount at once, then you can start investing through SIP with minimum monthly installment of as low as \u20b9100 or \u20b9500 (it differs for every scheme). Each time an investor makes a payment, the fund manager purchases more units of the assets that is shares and securities of the firms the fund is invested in. This gradually increases the number of units owned by the investor and hence SIPs are suitable for the long term. \nBenefits of Investing via Systematic Investment Plan (SIP):\t\nThrough SIP, one invests periodic amounts instead of a larger sum. The fund manager can purchase more units of market-linked instruments (equities and debt) every time. More units are bought when stock prices are low and vice versa. Thus, a SIP enables you to lower the average cost of your investment and reduce the risk associated with market volatility by spreading the purchase price over time. This is known as rupee cost averaging. A SIP enables you to regularly increase your investment amount by a fixed amount. The returns are calculated on the amount invested plus the previous returns. Thus, the returns are compounded and this is the power of compounding of a SIP.\nTypes of SIP includes Top up SIP, Flexible SIP, Perpetual SIP, Trigger SIP. Top-up SIP allows you to increase the SIP amount at regular intervals and take advantage of a well-performing mutual fund scheme by increasing your investment amount.  Flexible SIP allows you to increase or decrease the SIP amount as per your disposable income. Thus, with this SIP, you can decrease or skip the payment of a few installments when there is a cash crunch. Similarly, this mode also allows you to increase the SIP amount during an increase in cash inflows. While making a SIP investment, investors have a choice to provide the end date of the SIP. If the investor chooses to not give an end date then it is a perpetual SIP. This allows you to end your SIP at the time of your choice or when your financial goal is achieved since there is no fixed tenure attached. Trigger SIP is better suited for investors who have knowledge and awareness of financial markets. It allows you to set either an index level, NAV or a particular date as the start date of the SIP. However, it is not advisable to invest via a trigger SIP as it is essentially an attempt to time the market which is nearly impossible to do with 100% accuracy\nThe tax on SIPs depends on the nature of the mutual fund scheme \u2013 equity or non-equity. You can read about the tax treatment of equity and non-equity mutual funds here.\nMostly SIPs are used for equity funds and as per tax rules of all equity funds, capital gains up to Rs. 1 Lakh (after 1 year) are exempted from taxation, and the rest are taxed at 10% as per the taxation norms of Equity Funds. If the s/he redeems the fund in less than a year (ELSS are locked in for 3 years), then the capital gains will be taxed at 15% and no tax exemption will be provided. You can miss up to 3 installments. Automated SIP installment may get missed because of low account balance. In this case, banks may charge for not maintaining minimum balance.
